concrete:

Expand Section 2 to better explain scoped invariants (RA), and
illustrate the Hoare logic in proving external calls (RC).


generic:

We will ensure that all terms are explained before use -- either
informally, with a definition, or through application to an example --
including terms such as path, frame, access, external state, current
call, step, object reachable, state reachable, and pointer semantics.

Provide more examples and motivation e.g., discuss how reasoning about
access allows us to reason about internal fields; motivate the need
for the guarantee/invariant part in quadruples; design alternatives
for “protection”;

take further examples from the appendix to explain applicability of
our approach.


specific:

our approach works even when the internal and external code are in different programming languages;

introduce the execution diagrams... earlier

We will explicitly say early on that we have pointer semantics,

classOf function is standard ... defined in line 1370 -- Appendix A.

The formal material critically depends on the appendix -- will move
 the most salient parts of  that proof into section 2 (or section 8).

the appendix does not cover neither S3 (and in particular the
S4-related step for the external call), which is the actual property
we care about (see also point 2 below),

Another, substantial case study would help a lot with that front ---
We expect we will have space to discuss one or two of the problems
from Appendix E within the body text of a reviews draft.

talk in the related work about how this system could be used to
further prove correct other abstractions or program verification tools
that could be more automated,

how can we scale verification of defensive consistency?
- develop specifications for the internal code module such as those described in Section 7.
- reasoning about protection -- c.f. Fig. 6 -- and about external calls -- cf Fig. 7.
- turning our rules into lthoeorems offload the proof search to the tool

evaluation of the practical applicability and limitations of the idea
is almost non-existent.
