\section{Mandatory Changes}

\begin{itemize}
\item
\emph{Address Rev\_A’s question about evaluating the quality of a specification -- more later.}:
\item
\emph{Tone down all strong words used; (we were somewhat lead astray by the pun in the title), e.g. “insight” is sufficient, rather than “breakthrough insight”,}
\item
\emph{Drop the statements that no Hoare logic supports infinite intersections.}
\item
\emph{Improve comparisons with related work section.}
\item
\emph{Address all technical questions raised by Rev\_A -- more later.}
\item
\emph{Improve the explanations of Def. 3.9}
\item
\emph{Follow any further suggestions by the reviewers}
\end{itemize}

% For emergent behaviour we will include the reviewer's statement and also say that ``(S2) does not take account of the module's \emph{emergent behaviour}. That is, (S2) does not consider the behavior that emerges from the interaction between the 
%\texttt{transfer} method, and the other methods of the bank module. What if the module leaks the password?''
% 
% We will replace the current Bank Account proof with a simpler Coq proof that matches the straightforward introductory example. We will put the current example in an appendix so that we can 
%show reasoning about ghost fields and more complex data structures. 
%
%We will move the clarifying examples to Section 2.
%
%The largest piece of work is the proof and that shouldn't take more than a week so we believe that we can make substantial improvements in presentation before mid January.
