\section{Mandatory Changes}

\begin{itemize}
\item
\emph{Address Rev\_A’s question about evaluating the quality of a specification}:

\begin{itemize}
\item
We provided a proof sketch of our claim in Section 2.3.1, that ${\mathcal S}_{robust2}$ guarantees that from a scope which does not
have (transitive) external access to the password, the balance will not increase, even though the context calling that scope might have
(transitive) external access to the password.

\item
We have also improved the discussion in section 2.3.1. 
\end{itemize}

\item
\emph{Tone down all strong words used;  e.g. “insight” is sufficient, rather than “breakthrough insight”,}

Done
\item
\emph{Drop the statements that no Hoare logic supports infinite intersections.}

Done
\item
\emph{Improve comparisons with related work section.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
We are now in touch with  the authors of some of the related work. 

\item
We have improved the comparison with the work by Swasey et al according to the authors' feedback. 

\item
We are also happy to implement any further, specific instructions from the reviewers. 
\end{itemize}

\item
\emph{Address all technical questions raised by Rev\_A -- more later.}

???

\item
\emph{Improve the explanations of Def. 3.9}

We have re-worked the explanations of Def. 3.9  and 3.10, so as to first explain the intuitions of the necessity operators regardless of the adaptation operator, also using a new  diagram (Fig. 3), and examples (lines  605-615), and then defined the adaptation operator (lines 616-668).
\item
\emph{Follow any further suggestions by the reviewers}
\end{itemize}

% For emergent behaviour we will include the reviewer's statement and also say that ``(S2) does not take account of the module's \emph{emergent behaviour}. That is, (S2) does not consider the behavior that emerges from the interaction between the 
%\texttt{transfer} method, and the other methods of the bank module. What if the module leaks the password?''
% 
% We will replace the current Bank Account proof with a simpler Coq proof that matches the straightforward introductory example. We will put the current example in an appendix so that we can 
%show reasoning about ghost fields and more complex data structures. 
%
%We will move the clarifying examples to Section 2.
%
%The largest piece of work is the proof and that shouldn't take more than a week so we believe that we can make substantial improvements in presentation before mid January.

% A list of the changes that you plan to make in
%  response to the reviews and the timeline for those changes.

%  with context extracted from the reviews. Use markdown syntax.
