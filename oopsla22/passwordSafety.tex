\section{Proof of Guarantee of Safety in \S\ref{sec:how}}
\label{app:safety}

In this section we provide a proof sketch that \SrobustB ensures our balance
does not decrease in contexts with no access to our password. This 
property is expressed in \S\ref{sec:how}, and the example is repeated below.

\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape=true, language=chainmail, frame=lines]
module $\ModParam{1}$
     ...
    method cautious(untrusted:Object)
        a = new Account
        p = new Password
        a.set(null,p)
        ...
        untrusted.make_payment(a)
        ...
\end{lstlisting}
\jm[]{
The guarantee for the above code snippet is that  as long as 
\prg{untrusted} does not have external access (whether transitive or direct)
to \sdN{\prg{a.pwd}} before the call on line 7, then \prg{a.balance} will not decrease during the 
execution of line 8. This property is expressed and proven in Theorem \ref{thm:safety}.
}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item
%suppose we rewrite \prg{Mod$\_1$} such that we duplicate all methods used in line 7. In the duplicated version of the methods
%we add a tuple as an argument that contains the account, and the current password. In every duplicate method, whenever the
%method \prg{setPassword} is called, we check if the receiver is \prg{a}, and if so we update the password in the tuple to the 
%new password. In this manner by the end of line 7, we still know what the password of the account is.
%\item
%We then insert the following code at the end of line 7:\\
%\prg{a.setPassword(t.snd(), new Password())}
%\item
%We are now in an arising program state where there is no external knowledge of the password, and we are able to apply \SrobustB
%\end{itemize}

%\begin{lemma}[Out of Scope heap locations are not modified by execution]
%Let $\sigma_1 = (\chi_1, \phi_1 : \psi)$ and $\sigma_2 = (\chi_2, \phi_2 : \psi)$ be program states such that
%$\reductions{M}{M'}{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2}$ for some modules $M$ and $M'$.
%Let $\chi = \chi_A \cup \chi_B$, where $\chi_A$ is the portion of the heap that is not
%transitively accessible by $\phi_1.(\prg{this})$ (i.e. the transitive closure of $\access{\_}{\_}$), then $\chi_A \subset \chi_2$.
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%We proceed simply by contradiction. Suppose that $\chi_A \not\subset \chi_2$, that means that there must 
%have been some single execution step where $\chi_A$ was modified. Such a step requires access to some object $o$
%in $\chi_A$. Thus, there must have been some series of execution steps that provided access to $o$ to an object $o'$
%that is transitively accessible from $\phi_1.(\prg{this})$. This contradicts our premise.
%\end{proof}

%\begin{lemma}[Execution is unaffected by out of scope heap locations]
%\label{lemma:scoped-execution}
%Let $\sigma_1 = (\chi_1, \phi_1 : \psi)$ and $\sigma_2 = (\chi_2, \phi_2 : \psi)$ be program states such that
%$\reductions{M}{M'}{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2}$ for some modules $M$ and $M'$.
%Let $\chi = \chi_A \cup \chi_B$, where $\chi_A$ is the portion of the heap that is not
%transitively accessible by $\phi_1.(\prg{this})$ (i.e. the transitive closure of $\access{\_}{\_}$), then 
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item
%there exists $\chi_C$ such that $\chi_2 = \chi_A \cup \chi_C$ and 
%\item
%for any $\chi_A'$, we have $\reductions{M}{M'}{(\chi_A' \cup \chi_B, \phi_1 : \psi)}{(\chi_A' \cup \chi_C, \psi_2)}$
%\end{enumerate}
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%In both instances we proceed simply by contradiction. 
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item
%Suppose that $\chi_A \not\subset \chi_2$, that means that there must 
%have been some single execution step where $\chi_A$ was modified. Such a step requires access to some object $o$
%in $\chi_A$. Thus, there must have been some series of execution steps that provided access to $o$ to an object $o'$
%that is transitively accessible from $\phi_1.(\prg{this})$. Such a series of execution steps requires transitive
%access from $\sigma.(\prg{this})$ (whether by method calls or field accesses) since heap locations in \Loo are unforgeable.
%Such a case would imply transitive access from $\sigma.(\prg{this})$ to $o$. This contradicts our premise.
%
%\item
%For execution to differ in the modified program state $(\chi_A' \cup \chi_B, \phi_1 : \psi)$,
%that would imply that there must have been at least one execution step that differed in outcome due to the presence of $\chi_A'$ over $\chi_A$.
%By case analysis on the semantics of \Loo detailed in Fig. \ref{f:loo-semantics}, we can see that in each instance for 
%a result from execution to differ as a result a modification to the heap (when all else remains that same), would require transitive access 
%to the modified portion of the heap. Again, as before this implies a contradiction to our original premise.
%\end{enumerate}
%\end{proof}

%\begin{lemma}[Constructing an Effectively Equivalent Heap]
%\label{lemma:garbage}
%Let $\sigma = (\chi_A \cup \chi_B, \phi : \psi)$ be a program state arising (in the context of internal module $M_I$, and external module $M_E$)
%and let $o$ be an object in $\chi_B$, where $\chi_A$ is the set of all objects that are 
%not transitively accessible by $o$. Let $p$ be some internal object in $\chi_B$ of class $C$. There exists some 
%$M_E'$ and $\chi_A'$ such that $(\chi_A' \cup \chi_B, \phi : \psi)$ is \textit{Arising}
%in modules $M_I$ and $M_E'$ and for all $o'$ in $\chi_A'$, $\satisfies{M_I; (\chi_A', \chi_B, \phi : \psi)}{\neg \access{o}{o'}}$
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%The solution is to start by creating an $M_E'$ that results in such a $\chi_A'$. To attain such a module we
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item
%add a \prg{nullify} method to all classes in $M_E$, that when called replaces all references to objects of type $C$ with \prg{null}
%\item
%for each instance in the execution from the initial program state until $\sigma$, whenever an external object with 
%access to an object of type $C$ is about to leave scope for the remainder of that execution (whether by overwriting a reference, or by making a method call),
%a duplicate of that method is made, and in the duplicate we insert a call to \prg{nullify} on that object. The current call 
%is then replaced with a call to the duplicate of that method
%\end{enumerate}
%In this way we are effectively manually ``garbage collecting'' objects of type $C$. The result of this $M_E'$ will be a $\chi_A'$ that does not have
%any references to object $p$. Further, since the process only works when objects leave scope, none of the modified objects will be in $\chi_B$.

{\bf{Proof Idea}}

\noindent
The challenge in constructing a proof is that \SrobustB is not directly applicable to \sdN{$\sigma_3$} since there may exist  external 
objects that have access to \prg{a.password}, depending on the contents of the code in \prg{s}. For example, if \prg{s} 
is the empty code, then $\sigma_1.(\prg{this})$ has access to \prg{a}. 

\sdN{To address this challenge}, we will   create 
a program state, say \sdN{$\sigma_3'$}. In the new program state $\sigma_3'$ there will be no external access to \prg{a.password}. 
Also, $\sigma_3'$  must be similar enough to 
$\sigma_3$ so  that the execution of \prg{untrusted.make\_payment(a, z1, ..., zn)} \sdN{in $\sigma_3$ is effectively
 equivalent to that $\sigma_3'$ }
 are  effectively equivalent. \sdN{Moreover,}  \sdN{$\sigma_3'$}, must also be \textit{Arising} for us to apply the \Nec specification 
\SrobustB to it. \sdN{This throws up a new challenge: $\sigma_3'$ is not necessarily \textit{Arising} in \prg{BankMdl} and $M$. We address the latter challenge by creating a new module, $M'$, such that  $\arising{M'}{\prg{BankMdl}}{\sigma_3'}$.}

\vspace{.1in}

\noindent
{\bf{Proof Sketch}}

\noindent
We construct $M'$ from $M$ by 1) modifying  all methods in all 
classes in $M$  so that all methods are duplicated: a) the original version, and b) 
a version almost identical  to that in $M$ with the addition that it keeps track of all the objects which contain fields pointing to
any objects of the \prg{Password} class, 
2) We add to all classes in $M$ a method called \prg{nullify}
that compares the contents of each of its fields with the method's argument, and if they are
equal overwrites the field with \prg{null}, 
3) all method calls  are replaced by those in part 1a, except of the body of \prg{make\_payment},
4) we modify the code in \prg{s} (and any methods called from it) so that it also keeps track of the current value of
\prg{a.pwd}, 
5) after \prg{s} and before the call \prg{untrusted.make\_payment(a, z1, ..., zn)} we insert  code which
runs through the list created in part 1, and calls \prg{nullify} with the current value of \prg{a.pwd} by \prg{null} as its argument.

By staring with the same initial configuration which reached $\sigma_3$,
 but now using $M'$ as the external module, we reach $\sigma_3'$, 
that is, $\arising{M'}{\prg{BankMdl}}{\sigma_3'}$. Moreover,  $\sigma_3'$ 
satisfies the premise of  \SrobustB. 
We execute$\prg{untrusted}\prg{.make\_payment}\prg{(a, z1, ..., zn)}$ in the context of   $\sigma_3'$ 
and reach $\sigma_4'$. We apply  \SrobustB, and obtain that $\satisfies{\prg{BankMdl};\sigma_4'}{\prg{a.balance} \geq b}$.

We use the latter fact, to conclude that $\satisfies{\prg{BankMdl};\sigma_4}{\prg{a.balance} \geq b}$.
Namely, $\sigma_3$ and $\sigma_3'$ are equivalent -- up to renaming of addresses  -- for all all the objects which are
reachable from \prg{o}, \prg{z1}, ... \prg{zn}, and for all objects from 
$\prg{BankMdl}$. Therefore, the execution of \prg{make\_payment} in $M;\prg{BankMdl}$ and $\sigma_3$
will be "equivalent" to that in $M';\prg{BankMdl}$ and $\sigma_3'$. Therefore, $\sigma_4$ and $\sigma_4'$ are equivalent -- up to renaming of addresses  -- for all all the objects which are
reachable from \prg{o}, \prg{z1}, ... \prg{zn} and for all objects from 
$\prg{BankMdl}$.
This gives us that  $\satisfies{\prg{BankMdl};\sigma_4}{\prg{a.balance} \geq b}$.

%\prg{candidates}.
% We also modify the code in \prg{s} in two ways: 1) We keep track of the current value of \prg{a.pwd}, and 2) at the end  of 
%
%
% the statements \prg{s}, so that the code in \prg{s} keeps track of the current 
%value of \prg{a.pwd}, and keeps a list of all external objects which have a field pointing to \prg{a.pwd} -- this requires that methods
%in $M'$ are modified to accommodate this. Moreover, at the end of these modified statements, we replace all such 
%By Lemma \ref{lemma:garbage}, we know that there exists such a program state, and that we can construct it. By Lemma \ref{lemma:scoped-execution} this will 
%not alter the execution of \prg{untrusted.make\_payment(a, z1, ..., zn)}.
%Thus, it follows that \prg{a.balance} in $\chi_3'$ is equal to \prg{a.balance} in $\chi_3$.
%Since \SrobustB is applicable to $\sigma_3'$, we can conclude that \prg{a.balance} in $\chi_4'$ (and thus $\chi_4$)
