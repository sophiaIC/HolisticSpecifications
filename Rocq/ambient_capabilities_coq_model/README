This artifact contains the Coq source files for the paper "Reasoning about External Calls"

coqc version 8.17.0 is required to compile the proofs.

Compilation can be performed by executing:
            make
in the root folder.

An html index of the Coq model is built in ./html

The artifact is structured as follows:

common.v                      Some common definitions used across the entirel model/proofs
language_def.v                The definition of the core syntax of the underlying language, assertions, specifications, etc.
subst.v                       Some definitions for subsititution
operational_semantics.v       The operational semantics of the underlying language
assert.v                      The semantics of the assertion langauge
assert_theory.v               Lemmas concerning properties of the assertion language
hoare.v                       The semantics and rules of the hoare logic
spec.v                        The rules for specification satisfaction
shop.v                        The definition of the shop example
assumptions.v                 All assumptions made for the proof of the Shop example, i.e. assumptions on the underlying hoare logic, assertion language, etc
shop_lemmas.v                 Secondary lemmas that help prove the core proofs of the Shop example
