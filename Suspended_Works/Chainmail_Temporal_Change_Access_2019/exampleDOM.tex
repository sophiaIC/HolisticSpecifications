\emph{Attenuation} is the ability to provide an untrusted client \emph{restricted}  access to an object's functionality. This is usually achieved through the introduction of an intermediate object. Such intermediate objects --- protection proxies \cite{gof} --- are a common design pattern, and their security properties have been studied at length in the object capabilities literature \cite{MillerPhD,murray10-infoflow}.

\citet{dd} proposed specifications for attenuation of trees of DOM  nodes.
Access to a DOM node
gives access to its parent and all its children nodes, and the ability to
modify the properties of any accessible node. As the top nodes of the
tree usually contain privileged information (such as web content
showing your banking details) while the lower nodes contain less
crucial information (such as advertisements for BREXIT) we want to be
able to limit access given to third parties to only the lower part of
the DOM tree (so that Jacob Rees-Mogg cannot access your bank
account). We do this through a \prg{Wrapper}, which has
a field \prg{node} pointing to a \prg{Node} in the underlying DOM, and a field \prg{height}.
\forget{
which restricts the range of \prg{Node}s which may be modified through
the use of the particular \prg{Wrapper}.Namely, }
When you hold
a \prg{Wrapper} you can modify the \prg{property} of all the
descendants of the \prg{height}-th ancestors of the \prg{node} of that
particular \prg{Wrapper}. 
\forget{ It is not difficult to write such
a \prg{Wrapper}; a possible implementation appears in
Figure \ref{fig:DOM} in appendix \ref{DOM:traditional}.}


Figure \ref{fig:WrapperUse} shows a
\prg{Wrapper} object attenuating the use of 
\prg{Node}s.
The
function \prg{usingWrappers} has as its parameter an object of unknown
provenance, here called \prg{unknwn}. We create a tree
consisting of nodes \prg{n1}, \prg{n2}, ... \prg{n6}, depicted as blue
circles on the right-hand-side of the Figure and a
wrapper for \prg{n5} with height \prg{1}. This means that the
wrapper \prg{w} may be used to modify
 the objects in the green triangle, while it cannot be used to
modify the objects within the
blue triangle.  We call a function named \prg{untrusted} on
the \prg{unknwn} object, and pass \prg{w} as argument.

Even though we know nothing about the \prg{unknwn} object or
its \prg{untrusted} function, and even though the call gives
to \prg{unknwn} access to \prg{w}, which in turn has transitively
access to the entire tree, we know that %the call to
the \prg{untrusted} function will not
affect the \prg{property} fields of the nodes \prg{n1}, \prg{n2},
and \prg{n4}.  Thus, the assertion is guaranteed to
succeed.  The question is how do we specify \prg{Wrapper}, so as to be
able to make such an argument. %prove this assertion.

A specification of the class \prg{Wrapper} in the traditional
style, \cite{Leavens-etal07} \forget{\cf appendix \ref{DOM:traditional})}
consists of pairs of PRE- and POST- conditions for each of the
functions of that class. 
\forget{Each such pair gives a {\em sufficient}
condition for some effect to take place: for example the
call \prg{w.setProperty(i,prp)} where \prg{i} is smaller
than \prg{w.height} is a sufficient condition to modify \prg{property}
of the \prg{i}-th parent of \prg{w.node}. But we do not know what
other ways there may be to modify a node's \prg{property}.}  
A broken
wrapper could accidentally permit access to nodes one or two levels
above the expected height due to off-by one errors. More seriously,
a malicious wrapper could offer a
back-door public accessor method that leaks the underlying DOM
object through the wrapper, returning direct access to any of the
other nodes in the DOM, or even to queue a task to
delete every property at midnight GMT on 29 March 2019. All of these errors are possible while
preserving the PRE- and POST- conditions expected of a \prg{Wrapper}. 

\forget{
What is needed here is some way to specify the \emph{necessary
conditions}
under which some change could be made: if some external client is to
change a node's property, then  that client must have either direct
access to a node in that DOM tree, or indirect access via a wrapper
configured so that it can change the affected node.

The \emph{necessary} condition for the modification of \prg{nd.property} for some \prg{nd} of class \prg{Node}  is either access to some   \prg{Node} in the same tree, or  access to a \prg{w} of class \prg{Wrapper} where the \prg{w.height}-th parent of \prg{w} is an ancestor of \prg{nd}.

That is, if the value of \prg{nd.property} is modified
($\Changes{\_}$) at some future time ($\Future{\_}$) and if reaching
that future time involves no more objects than those from set \prg{S}
(\ie ${\Using{\_} {\prg{S}}}$), then at least one (\prg{o}) of the
objects in \prg{S} is not a \prg{Node} nor a \prg{Wrapper},
and \prg{o} has direct access to some node
($\CanAccess{\prg{o}}{\prg{nd}'}$), or to some wrapper \prg{w} and
the \prg{w.height}-th parent of \prg{w} is an ancestor of \prg{nd}
(that is,
$\prg{parnt}^k\!=\!\prg{w.node}.\prg{parnt}^{\prg{w.height}}$).

% It is important to clarify what we mean by ``access''.

\forget{
Definitions of these concepts appear later
(Definition \ref{def:valid:assertion}), but note that our ``access''
is intransitive: $\CanAccess x y$ holds if either \prg{x} has a field
pointing to \prg{y}, or \prg{x} is the receiver and \prg{y} is one of
the arguments in the executing method call.
 
In the next sections we proceed with a formal model of our model. In the appendix we discuss more -- and simpler -- examples.
We chose the DOM for the introduction, in order to give a flavour of the \Chainmail features.
