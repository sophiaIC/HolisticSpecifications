Software guards our secrets, our money, our intellectual property,
our reputation \cite{covern}.  We entrust personal and
corporate information to software which works in an \emph{open} world, 
where  it interacts with a vast number of
third party software of unknown provenance, possibly buggy and potentially malicious.

Thus, we expect and hope that our software will be \emph{robust}:
We expect and hope our software to behave correctly even if  used 
by erroneous or malicious third parties. Robustness means 
something different for each different software.
 We expect, \eg, that our bank will only make payments 
from our account if instructed by us or somebody authorized CITE-ERC20,
that  space on a web given to an advertiser will not be used
to obtain access to our bank details ... CITE-SOME-DOM-HORROR.

The importance of robustness has lead to the design of many programming
language mechanisms which help write robust programs:
constant fields or methods \cite{...}, private methods/fields\cite{...}, ownerschip\cite{...}
as well as the object capability paradigm\cite{millerPhDThesis},
and its adoption in recent programming languages and web systems
\cite{CapJavaHayesAPLAS17,CapNetSocc17Eide,DOCaT14} including Newspeak
\cite{newspeak17}, Dart \cite{dart15}, Grace \cite{grace,graceClasses}
and Wyvern \cite{wyverncapabilities}

While such programming language mechanisms make it \textit{possible} to write robust
programs, they cannot \textit{ensure} that programs are robust. 
To be able to do this, we need to be able to specify what robustness means for the 
particular program, and we need to be able to demonstrate that the particular program 
adheres to the specific robustness requirements.

There has been a plethora of work on the functional specification and verification of the
functional correctness of programs. Such specification describe what are
essentially \emph{sufficient} conditions for some
effect to happen. For example, if you make a payment request to your bank, money will be transfered
and as a result your funds will be reduced: the payment request is a sufficient condition for the
reduction of funds. However, a bank client is also interested in \emph{necessary} conditions:
they want to be assured that no reduction in their funds will take place unless they themselves
requested it.

One may argue that the necessary conditions are not more than the complement of all the sufficient conditions.
In other words, that the bahaviour of a module is the union of all possible behaviours described by the 
functions in that module, as shown in the right hand side of the diagram in Figure \ref{fig:NecessaryAndSuff}.
This is mathematically correct. But it is impractical. It suggests that the client interested in a necessity guarantee 
would have to read the specifications of all the functions in a module so as to extract the .... say that lots of functions-this way is indirect ... say that functions may be added later.

%However what has been less well-studied
%so far, is the characterization of the ways in which a system is robust, \ie how do we
%specify robustness. What exactly do we expect from a module in 
%
% 
%The traditional (philosophically, the ``modern'' approach) to
%construct secure systems is to build up trusted components as an
%hierarchy on top of a known and trusted secured computing base,
%underpinned by verified and verifying compilers \cite{HoareManifesto}.
%This approach relies on a closed world assumption: there is an
%explicitly demarcated border between the inside and the outside of the
%system, and the whole system can be trusted because (and as long as)
%each component inside the border can be trusted. Similarly, each
%module is an independent demesnes \cite{wills}, jealously
%protecting its own invariants behind its own borders, giving rise to a
%series of layers of trust, layered virtual machines
%\cite{nosp} or protection rings \cite{pola}.
%
%Open
%systems, on the other hand, have an open world assumption: they must
%interact with a wide range of component objects with different levels
%of mutual trust (or distrust) --- and whose configuration dynamically
%changes.
%%
%% Consider electronic payments systems such as Swift, Paypal,
%% or WeSwap.com: they must transfer funds between participants'
%% accounts, where the participants do not trust each other, cannot be
%% trusted by the payments system, and may join or leave the system at
%% any time.  With multiple competing payments systems across different
%% international juristidctions, there is no central authority that can
%% vouch for the trusworthiness of participants or payments systems.
%%
%Given a method request \lstinline+x.m(y)+, what can
%we conclude about the behaviour of this request if we know nothing
%about the receiver \lstinline+x+?
% 
%
%The critical
%problem with building systems for an open world is that the actual
%invariants that must be maintained by a program will be
%\textit{implicit}, scattered throughout the program's modules.  Any
%part of a program that uses an object from a trusted module may (by
%oversight, error, or fraud) hand that object to an untrustworthy
%module, giving potentially malicious code access to all the services
%provided by the trustworthy module \cite{geneva91,aliasingBook}.  This
%makes it hard to determine what invariants are actually maintained by
%a given module, and thus verify the integrity of the overall system.
%%
%Miller \cite{miller-esop2013,MillerPhD} defines the necessary approach
%as \textbf{defensive consistency}: \textit{``An object is defensively
%  consistent when it can defend its own invariants and provide correct
%  service to its well behaved clients, despite arbitrary or malicious
%  misbehaviour by its other clients.''}  Defensively consistent
%modules are particularly hard to design, to write, to understand, and
%to verify: but they have the great advantage that they make it much
%easier to make guarantees about systems composed of multiple components
%\cite{Murray:phd}.
%
%
%In this paper, we present a modular specification language,
%\Chainmail, that is designed to support defensively consistent
%specifications of these kinds of open
%systems. Building on the object-capability model \cite{Elang},
%\Chainmail\ specifications are modular, as separate concerns in a
%system can be captured in as individual specification or policy
%definitions.  \Chainmail\ specifications 
%not tied to any particular module in a system but can define
%the behaviour of any complying module, and can cross-cut multiple
%modules.  \Chainmail\ policies define not only method pre- and post-
%conditions, but also give invariants that must be maintained
%\emph{irrespective} of any other code in the system, even when the
%actual composition of the system is unknown.  Taken together, this
%means that \Chainmail\ can specify modules that must be
%\emph{defensively consistent}, guaranteeing their integrity in an
%arbitrary open world.

%\paragraph{Contribution} 
%This paper extends earlier informal work mostly presented at
%workshops~\cite{capeFTfJP,capeFTfJP14,swapsiesOnTheInternet2015,capeIFM14}.
%Here we present the full design of \Chainmail\ for the first time, and
%show how \Chainmail\ allows us to write modular, multi-dimensional
%specifications for the open world.  As is traditional, some details
%are relegated to a technical report~\cite{appendix}.
%
%To address the open nature of the systems, we make the meaning of
%policies parametric with any code that may be linked to the
%current system.  We give examples to show how \Chainmail\ modules can
%be written in a very robust, defensively consistent manner, so that no
%further, malicious code can steal their secrets or break their
%integrity.
%
%% This has let us give a
%% formal meaning to Miller's \emph{defensive consistency} for the first
%% time. \tobym{Not quite true. I had a stab at defining defensive correctness
%% and consistency in my PhD thesis, which I've summarised in \autoref{sec:related}.}
%
%Our design of \Chainmail\ is part of a larger research project about
%specifying and verifying systems in an open world.  Security is of
%particular concern in open systems, and \Chainmail\ includes
%assertions such as (\obeys, \MayAffect, and \MayAccess) to allow
%us to reason explicitly about module's security properties and
%guarantees.  Elsewhere we demonstrate how these constructs let us
%describe how components can co{\"o}perate to establish trust
%gradually, and to delineate the risks involved in that co{\"o}peration
%\cite{POSTSUBMITTED}. Security, trust, and risk are not the focus of
%this paper, rather here we concentrate on the core features of
%\Chainmail, showing how \Chainmail\ policies permit modular,
%defensively consistent specifications.
%
%To give a semantics to \Chainmail\ policies we have also defined a
%core object-oriented programming language, \LangOO, (the Featherweight
%Object Capability Language, not to be confused with FOCAL
%\cite{FOCAL-69}), described in more detail elsewhere \cite{appendix}.
%\LangOO\ is a simple, dynamically typed language with traditional
%classes as its modularly mechanism.  That is, \Chainmail\ provides
%separation of concerns for \emph{specifications} of object-oriented
%\emph{implementations}.  We made this design choice for several
%reasons, primarily because we are interested in specifications, rather
%than implementations.  We are primarily
%interested in specifying ``real world'' programs, which tend to be
%written in OO languages like JavaScript, Java or E, rather than e.g.\
%aspect- or subject- oriented languages; and that we wanted to keep
%\LangOO\ as simple as possible.  We hope to extend our specification
%techniques to more modular languages in future work.
%
%To prove a program's adherence to \Chainmail\ specifications, we have
%developed a Hoare logic and associated inference rules.  We do not
%discuss the logic or these rules in this paper, although they are
%present in the technical report \cite{appendix}.
