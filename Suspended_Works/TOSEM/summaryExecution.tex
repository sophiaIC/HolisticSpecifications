%As was have seen, \Chainmail assertions not only talk about the contents of the current state (stack frame and heap),
%but they also talk about future and past states, Therefore, 
The meaning of \Chainmail assertions is parametric with an
underlying object-oriented programming language, with modules  as repositories of code, classes with fields, methods and
ghostfields, objects described by classes, a way to link  modules into larger ones, and a concept of 
program execution\footnote{We believe that \Chainmail can be applied to 
any language with these features.}.

We have developed   \LangOO, a \jm{deterministic and} minimal such object-oriented language, which we
outline in  this section. 
We  describe the novel aspects of \LangOO, and 
summarise the more conventional parts, relegating  full, and mostly unsurprising,
definitions %for  \LangOO~appear 
to Appendix \ref{app:LangOO}.
 

Modules are \jm{as} central to \LangOO, as they are to \Chainmail. As modules are repositories
of code, we adopt the common formalisation of modules as maps from 
class identifiers to class definitions\jm{, c.f. Appendix \ref{app:LangOO}, Def \ref{defONE}}
%\appref{defONE}. 
We use the terms module and component in an
analogous manner to class and object respectively.  \LangOO is untyped 
\sophia{for several reasons. Many popular programming languages are untyped.
The external module might be untyped, and so it is more
general to consider everything as untyped.
Finally, 
a solution that works for an untyped language %(doesnt depend on types) 
will also apply to a typed language, while the converse is not true.
}
%, where we link with external modules which come without any
%guarantees.

 Class definitions consist of field, method and ghost field declarations\jm{, c.f. Appendix \ref{app:LangOO}, Def \ref{def:syntax:classes}}.
%\appref{def:syntax:classes}.
Method bodies are sequences of 
statements, which  can be field reads or field assignments, object
creation, method calls, and return statements. 
%All else, \eg booleans, conditionals, loops,  can be encoded.
Fields are private in the sense of C++ or Java: they can only be read or
written by methods of the current class.
This is enforced by the operational semantics, \cf Fig.~\ref{fig:Execution}.
We  discuss ghost fields in the next section.

Runtime configurations, $\sigma$,  contain   all the usual information about execution snapshots: the heap, and a
stack of frames. 
% sd dropped fillowing sentence as it appears afterwards
%The code to be executed is kept as part of the runtime configuration:
%
Each frame consists of a continuation, \prg{contn}, describing the remaining code to be executed by the
frame, and a map from
variables to values. Values are either addresses or sets of addresses; sets 
are needed to deal with assertions which quantify over sets of
objects, such as assertions
(1) and (2) from Section \ref{sect:motivate:Bank}.
% 
We define \emph{one-module} execution  through a judgment of the form $\M, \sigma \leadsto \sigma'$ in Appendix~\ref{app:LangOO}, Fig.~\ref{fig:Execution}. 
%
  

%\subsection{\sdf{Modules satisfying assertions}}
%
%Finally, we define satisfaction of assertions by modules: a module
%$\M$ satisfies an assertion $\A$ if for all other potential modules $\M'$, in all configurations arising from executions of $\M\mkpair\M'$, the assertion $\A$ holds.

%\begin{definition}
%\label{def:module_satisfies}
%For any module $\M$, and  assertion $\A$, we define:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item
%$\M \models \A \ \ \  \ \ \ \ \ \mbox{
%if               } \ \ \  \ \ \  \  \forall \M'.\forall \sigma_0 \in \Initial{\M \mkpair \M'}.\forall\sigma\in\Arising{\M \mkpair  {\M'}, \sigma_0}. [\ \M \mkpair  {\M'}, \sigma_0 , \sigma \models \A\ ]$
%\end{itemize}
%\end{definition}
  
  

\subsubsection{\sdf{Linking and two-state execution}}

We define a module linking operator \  $\link$ \  so that
$\M\link\M'$ is the union of the two modules, provided that their domains are disjoint\appref{def:link}.
 %
As we said in Section \ref{sect:overviewmodel}, we distinguish  between the internal and external module. \sophia{We consider execution  from the view of the
external module, and treat}  execution of 
methods from the internal module as atomic. For this, we define \emph{two-module execution}  based on
one-module execution as follows:

%Susan: I don't understand this when n = 2
\begin{definition}
\label{def:execution:internal:external}
\label{def:module_pair_execution} 
Given runtime configurations $\sigma$,  $\sigma'$,  and a module-pair $\M \mkpair \M'$ we define
execution where $\M$ is the internal, and $\M'$ is the external module as below:
 
\begin{itemize}
\item
$\M \mkpair \M', \sigma \leadsto \sigma'$ \IFF
there exist  $n\geq 2$ and runtime configurations $\sigma_1$,  ...
$\sigma_n$, \\such that
\begin{itemize}
\item
$\sigma$=$\sigma_1$,\ \  \ \ and\ \ \ \ $\sigma_n=\sigma'$.
\item
$\M \link \M', \sigma_i \leadsto \sigma_{i+1}$,\  \  for $1\leq i \leq n\!-\!1$
\item
$\ClassOf{\this} {\sigma}\not\in dom({\M})$,  \ \  \ \ and\ \ \ \
$\ClassOf{\this} {\sigma'} \not\in dom({\M})$,
\item
 $\ClassOf{\this} {\sigma_i} \in dom({\M})$,\ \ \ \ for $2\leq i \leq n\!-\!\Mrrz{1}$
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{definition}
 
In the definition above,  $\ClassOf {\x} {\sigma} $ looks up the class of the object \sophia{stored} at \x\appref{def:interp}.
% If  $n$  has the value $2$, %. In this case the final bullet is trivial and  
%then  there exists a direct, external transition from $\sigma$ to $\sigma'$.  
 For example, for $\sigma_4$ as in Section \ref{sect:chainmail} whose next statement to be executed 
 is  $\prg{a}_2.\prg{deposit}{\prg{(}}\prg{a}_3,\prg{360}{\prg{)}}$,  we would have 
 a sequence of configurations $\sigma_{41}$, ... $\sigma_{4n}$,  $\sigma_{5}$ so that the
  one-module execution gives
 $\M_{BA2}, \sigma_4 \leadsto \sigma_{41} \leadsto \sigma_{42} ... \leadsto \sigma_{4n}   \leadsto \sigma_{5}$.
This would correspond to an atomic evaluation in the two-module execution: \  \
 $\M_{BA2}\mkpair \M', \sigma_4 \ \leadsto \sigma_5$ (see Fig.\ref{fig:VisibleStates}; \sophia{where blue stands for $\sigma(this)\!\in\!M_1$,%
   and  orange for $\sigma(this)\!\in\!M_2$}).

Two-module execution  is related to % the concept of 
visible states
semantics \cite{MuellerPoetzsch-HeffterLeavens06} as they both filter configurations, with  the difference
that in visible states semantics % \sd{considers all intermediate configurations during execution, but
execution is unfiltered and  configurations are only filtered when it comes to the  consideration 
of class invariants\jm{,} while two-module execution filters execution.
%
The lemma below says  that linking is associative and commutative, and preserves   both one-module and two-module execution.

\begin{lemma}[Properties of linking]
\label{lemma:linking}
 For any modules $\M$,   $\M'$, $\M''$, and $\M'''$ and runtime configurations $\sigma$, and $\sigma'$ we have$:$
 \label{lemma:linking:properties}

 \begin{itemize}
     \item
     $(\M \link \M')\link \M''$ = $\M \link (\M' \link \M'')$  \hspace{1cm} and    \hspace{1cm}   $\M \link \M'$  = $\M' \link\M$.
      \item
      $\M, \sigma \leadsto \sigma'$, and $\M\link \M'$ is defined, \  \ \ \ \  implies\ \ \ \ \   $\M\link \M', \sigma \leadsto \sigma'$.
 \item
 $\M \mkpair \M', \sigma \leadsto \sigma'$   \  \ \ \ \  implies\ \ \ \ \  $(\M\link\M'') \mkpair (\M'\link\M''') ,\sigma \leadsto \sigma'$.  
  \end{itemize}

 \end{lemma}
 
 \subsubsection{Initial and Arising Configurations}

 
 We can now answer the question as to which runtime configurations are pertinent when judging a module's
adherence to an assertion.
{\em Initial configurations} are those whose heap  have only one object, of class \prg{Object}, and whose stack have one frame, with arbitrary \jm{an} continuation.
{\em Arising} configurations are  those that can be reached by two-module execution, starting from a specific initial configuration to maintain temporal linearity.
 
\begin{definition}[Initial and Arising Configurations] defined as follows, using the semantics from Definition~\ref{def:runtimeentities}: \label{def:arise}

\begin{itemize}
     \item
   $\Initial {(\psi,\chi)}$, \ \ if \ \ $\psi$ consists of a single frame $\phi$ with $dom(\phi)=\{ \this \}$, and there exists  some address $\alpha$, such that \ \ \    $\interp {\this}{\phi}$=$\alpha$, and \ $dom(\chi)$=$\alpha$,\  and\  
    $\chi(\alpha)=(\prg{Object},\emptyset)$.
 \item
 $\Arising  {\M\mkpair\M', \sigma_0} \ = \ \{ \ \sigma \ \mid \ \Initial{\sigma_0}\ \wedge\ \M\mkpair\M', \sigma_0 \leadsto^* \sigma \ \ \} $
 \end{itemize}

\end{definition}
\jm{Arising configurations differ in their definition to that of previous work published at FASE 2020~\cite{FASE} in the usage of an initial configuration. In prior work
an arising configuration was defined as any configuration that might arise from {\em any} initial configuration. In linearizing Chainmail, we specify a specific initial 
configuration.}

\subsubsection{Constrained Execution}


\jm{We define a specialized form of two-module execution, \emph{constrained execution}.}
\jm[I couldn't make the bar at the end of the $\leadsto$ smaller]{\begin{definition}[Constrained execution]  \label{def:reduction:constrained}
For any modules $\M$, $\M'$, and configurations $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$
\begin{itemize}
\item
$\M\mkpair \M',  \constrained \sigma_2$ 
\IFF
$\M\mkpair \M',  (\phi, \chi_1) \leadsto(\psi, \chi_2)$\\
$\strut ~ \hspace{1.4in} $ \hfill 
where
$\sigma_1 = (\phi \cdot \psi_1, \chi_1)$ and $\sigma_2 = (\psi \cdot \psi_1, \chi_2)$
and
\item
$\M\mkpair \M',  \sigma_1\constrained^* \sigma_2$ 
\IFF
$\M\mkpair \M',  (\phi, \chi_1) \leadsto^* (\psi, \chi_2)$\\
$\strut ~ \hspace{1.4in} $ \hfill 
where
$\sigma_1 = (\phi \cdot \psi_1, \chi_1)$ and $\sigma_2 = (\psi \cdot \psi_1, \chi_2)$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}}
\jm{Constrained execution (Definition \ref{def:reduction:constrained}) is a form of two-module execution
that is restricted to only those execution steps that arise from the top frame of the stack, thus excluding
execution steps beyond a method return from the top frame.}

\jm{Constrained execution is a strict subset of two-module execution, and for all modules $\M$ and $\M'$, and configurations $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$, 
if $\M\mkpair \M',  \sigma_1\constrained \sigma_2$ (or $\M\mkpair \M',  \sigma_1\constrained^* \sigma_2$), then 
it follows that $\M\mkpair \M',  \sigma_1 \leadsto \sigma_2$ (or $\M\mkpair \M',  \sigma_1\leadsto^* \sigma_2$). 
The reverse however is not true. Two-module execution does not imply constrained execution.
Since constrained execution does not consider any frames in the stack preceding the top frame of $\sigma_1$, 
$\sigma_2$ may only arise from the execution of the current method. For example, if the top frame of $\sigma_1$ 
is the result of a method call to some method $\prg{m}$, then constrained execution is restricted to only intermediate 
configurations that arise from the evaluation of $\prg{m}$, and not beyond that.}

\jm{Constrained execution is used in the definition of satisfaction of the temporal operators $\Future{A}$ and $\Next{A}$ (defined in Section~\ref{sect:assertions}).
This restriction is necessary when considering the future, 
as \Chainmail is generally 
concerned with the current state of the program, and those states that 
might arise as a result. As an example, 
specification (2) of the introductory bank account example asserts that future changes to a bank account implies the current object has access to that account.
If the execution implied by future assertions were not constrained, this would not necessarily be true unless we inspected every frame in the stack to check access.
Further, future satisfaction of assertions beyond the present frame
would have no relation to the present scope.}

%\jm{Further, the use of constrained reduction is necessary in maintaining some expected properties of the temporal operators. 
%While the underlying language \LangOO is deterministic and linear in its reduction, and thus there is exactly one path from the initial configuration of the program to any 
%future configuration that must pass through the current configuration, this is not generally true of languages with potentially branching reduction. If
%reduction of \LangOO were non-linear, and satisfaction of $\Future{\A}$ (or $\Next{\A}$) were not defined with constrained reduction, 
%the satisfaction of $\A$ would not generally imply the satisfaction of $\Future{\Past{A}}$ as $\A$ would not necessarily be satisfied by every branch of the program leading to the future configuration.
%The inverse however does hold, i.e. due to the use of an initial configuration it always holds that satisfaction of $\A$ implies satisfaction of $\Past{\Future{\A}}.$}
