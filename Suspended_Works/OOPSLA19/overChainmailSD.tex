In this Section we  give a brief and informal  overview of %the most salient features of  
\Chainmail -- a full exposition appears in Section \ref{sect:assertions}.



\sdparagraph{Example Configurations} We  will illustrate these concepts in terms of examples coming from  \prg{Bank}/\prg{Account} as  in the previous Section.
We  use the runtime configurations $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ 
shown in the left and right diagrams in Figure \ref{fig:BakAccountDiagrams}.
%These configurations could arise from the execution of different implementation of the \prg{Bank}/\prg{Account}
% module.
In both diagrams the rounded boxes depict objects:  green for those from the 
\prg{Bank}/\prg{Account} component, and grey for the ``external'',  ``client'' objects.
The transparent green rectangle  shows which objects are  part of  %contained by 
the \prg{Bank}/\prg{Account} component.
The object at \prg{1} is a \prg{Bank}, those at \prg{2}, \prg{3} and \prg{4} are 
\prg{Account}s, and those at \prg{91}, \prg{92}, \prg{93} and \prg{94} are 
``client'' objects which belong to classes different than those from the \prg{Bank}/\prg{Account}  module.

Each configuration represents one alternative implementation of the Bank object.
Configuration  $\sigma_1$ may arise from execution using a module $M_{BA1}$, where  \prg{Account} objects of
  have a field \prg{myBank} pointing to their \prg{Bank}, and an integer field  \prg{balance}
-- the code can be found in appendix~\ref{Bank:appendix} Fig.~\ref{fig:BanAccImplV1}.

\susan{I don't see what the code adds - these are completely
straightforward to imagine}
\james{yeah but longer appendices are clearly good, right?}
\sophia{We need these codes later on where we explain ghostfields}
Configuration  $\sigma_2$ may arise from execution using a module $M_{BA2}$,  where \prg{Account}s have a \prg{myBank}
field,  \prg{Bank} objects  have a \prg{ledger} implemented though a sequence of \prg{Node}s, each of which has a 
 field pointing to the \prg{Account}, a field \prg{balance}, and a
 field \prg{next} -- the code can be found in appendix~\ref{Bank:appendix}
Figs.~\ref{fig:BanAccImplV2a} and~\ref{fig:BanAccImplV2b}.

\sdparagraph{Classical Assertions} talk about the contents of the 
local variables (\ie the topmost stack frame), and the 
fields of the various objects (\ie the heap).  
  For example, the assertion  $\ \prg{a}_2.\prg{myBank}$=$\prg{a}_3.\prg{myBank} \ $, says that 
  $\prg{a}_1$ and  $\prg{a}_2$  have the same bank. In fact, this assertion is
  satisfied in both $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$, written formally as\\
  $\strut$ \hspace{1.1cm}  $...,\sigma_1 \ \models \ \prg{a}_2.\prg{myBank}=\prg{a}_3.\prg{myBank}$ 
  % , $\ \ \ $  and also 
%  $\strut$ \hspace{1.1cm} 
 \hspace{1cm}   $...,\sigma_2 \ \models \ \prg{a}_2.\prg{myBank}=\prg{a}_3.\prg{myBank}$.
   
 
  The term \prg{x}:\prg{ClassId} says that \prg{x} is an object of class \prg{ClassId}. For example\\
  $\strut$ \hspace{1.1cm}  $...,\sigma_1 \ \models \ \prg{b}_1 : \prg{Bank}$.
  
  We support ghost fields~\cite{Leavens-etal07}, \susan{this is the jml reference manual - if you want something else say}\sophia{I do not know where the term was introduced, also nit sure whether it is model fields or ghost fields. I asked Alex. Here a more respectable paper on that ESOP "A Verification Methodology for Model Fields"}
    \eg $\prg{a}_1$.\prg{balance} is a physical field in $\sigma_1$ and a ghost field in $\sigma_2$ since in \prg{MBA2} the \prg{Account}s do not store their \prg{balance}. \sd{The abstract function %this is a term from the ESOP'06 paper from aboove
    for \prg{balance} for \prg{MBA2} s is defined in  the body of class \prg{Account}}  in \prg{MBA2}  \sd{in the obvious way}.
  % so that for any \prg{a} of class \prg{Account} the value
  % of \prg{a.balance} is    \prg{nd}.\prg{balance} such that \prg{nd} is a \prg{Node},    and \prg{nd}.\prg{myAccount}=\prg{a},
   %  $\prg{a}.\prg{balance}$=\prg{m} if
%  \prg{a.myBank.next}$^k$.\prg{acc}=\prg{a}, and  \prg{a.myBank.next}$^k$.\prg{balance}=
\sd

We also support the usual logical connectives, and so, we can express assertions such as \\
$\strut$ \hspace{1.1cm}    $\forall \prg{a}. [ \ \ \prg{a}:\prg{Account} \ \longrightarrow \ \ \prg{a}.\prg{myBank}:\prg{Bank}\ \wedge\  \prg{a}.\prg{balance}\geq 0\ \ ] $ .



\sdparagraph{Permission: Access}
%
Our first holistic assertion, $\CanAccess{\x}{\y}$, asserts that  
object $\x$ has a direct reference to another object $\y$: either one
of $\x$'s fields contains a 
reference to $\y$, or the receiver of the currently executing method is \prg{x}, and \prg{y}
is one of the arguments or a local variable. 
For example:\\
 $\strut$ \hspace{1.1cm}  $...,\sigma_1 \ \models \  \CanAccess{\prg{a}_2}{\prg{b}_1}$
\\
If   $\sigma_1$ was currently executing  a call like ${\prg{a}_2}$.\prg{deposit}\prg{(}${\prg{a}_3}$,\prg{100.00}\prg{)}, then we 
would  have\\
 $\strut$ \hspace{1.1cm}  $...,\sigma_1 \ \models \  \CanAccess{\prg{a}_2}{\prg{a}_3}$, \\
 Namely, during execution of \prg{deposit}, $\prg{a}_2$ has access to $\prg{a}_3$, and could,
 %  in ptinciple and
 if the method body chose to,
 store a reference to $\prg{a}_3$ in its own fields. \sophia{ALL: does this clarify why 
 we define access to take method execution into account?}
 Note that access is not symmetric, nor transitive:\\
  $\strut$ \hspace{1.1cm}  $...,\sigma_1 \ \not\models \  \CanAccess{\prg{a}_3}{\prg{a}_2}$, \hspace{0.6cm}\\
  $\strut$ \hspace{1.1cm} 
  $...,\sigma_2 \ \models \  \CanAccessTr{\prg{a}_2}{\prg{a}_3}$, \hspace{0.6cm}
 %   $\strut$ \hspace{1.1cm}  
 $...,\sigma_2 \ \not\models \  \CanAccess{\prg{a}_2}{\prg{a}_3}$.


%\james{do we really not also need reachable (transitive closure of access)}
%\susan{we don't seem to need transitivity in any of the examples}
%\sophia{We do not want transitivity, our policies where access is in the conclusion would become too weak.}

\sdparagraph{Control: Calls}
%
The  assertion $\Calls {\x} {\y} {\m} {\zs}$
\sophia{it said " is more-or-less the control flow analogue of
the access assertion" -- that is a nice simile, but is it true?\kjx{I
think it's true}}  holds 
in program states where a method on object 
${\x}$ makes a method call ${\y}.{\m}({\zs})$ --- that is it calls method 
{\m} with object {\y} as the receiver, and with arguments {\zs}.
For example, \\
 $\strut$ \hspace{1.1cm}  $...,\sigma_0 \models \  \Calls {\x}{\prg{deposit}}  {\prg{a}_2}  {\prg{(}{\prg{a}_3},\prg{600}\prg{)}}$.\\
 %{{...}} {\prg{a}_2}} {\prg{deposit}} {\prg{(}{\prg{a}_3},\prg{100.00}\prg{)}}$.\\
 means that the receiver in %configuration 
 $\sigma_0$ is \x, and the next statement to be executed  
 is  $\prg{a}_2.\prg{deposit}\prg{a}_3,\prg{100.00}$.
 

%% \sdparagraph{Authority --  Changes and Internal/External}\sophia{Is it good to put these together?}
%% The assertion $\Changes{\prg{e}}$  holds when the value of {\prg{e}}
%% in the next configuration is different to the value in the current configuration.
%% For example, if the code being executed in $\sigma_1$ started with $\acc_2.\bal=\acc_2.\bal+\prg{100.00}$, then:\\
%%   $\strut$ \hspace{1.1cm}  $..., \sigma_1 \ \models \  \Changes {\acc_2.\bal}$.\\
%%   Moreover, the assertion $\External {\prg{e}}$ expresses that the object {\prg{e}} does not belong to the module under consideration. 
%%   For example, \\
%% $\strut$ \hspace{1.1cm}  $\M_{AB2}\mkpair ..., \sigma_2 \ \models \ \External{\pu_{92}}$,
%% %$\strut$ 
%% \hspace{1cm}  $\M_{AB2}\mkpair ..., \sigma_2 \ \not\models \ \External{\acc_2}$, \\
%% $\strut$
%%  \hspace{1.1cm}  $\M_{AB2}\mkpair ..., \sigma_2 \ \not\models \ \External{\pb_{1}.\prg{ledger}}$\\
%% Notice the use of the \emph{internal} module, $\M_{AB2}$, needed to judge which objects are internal, and which are external.
 

\sdparagraph{Space: ??}
The space assertion $\Using{\A}{\SF}$ states that  assertion $\A$ is
true in a configuration which has been restricted to only contain the 
objects from the set \SF. 
In other words, it restricts the set of objects which may be used to establish property \A. For example, 
if $\SF_1$ includes object \prg{94}, and  $\SF_2$ does not include  it, then we   have\\ 
 $\strut$ \hspace{1.1cm}  $..., \sigma_1 \ \models \ \Using{ \exists \prg{o}.[ \ \External{\prg{o}} \wedge \CanAccess{\prg{o}} {\acc_4}\ ]}{\SF_1}$\\
 $\strut$ \hspace{1.1cm}  $..., \sigma_1 \ \not\models \ \Using{ \exists \prg{o}.[ \ \External{\prg{o}} \wedge \CanAccess{\prg{o}} {\acc_4}\ ]} {\SF_2}$.\\
 $\Using{\A}{\SF}$  is therefore {\em not} the footprint of the assertion $\A$; it is more like the \emph{fuel} \cite{stepindex}
 given to establish that assertion. Note that $\Using {\A} {\SF}$ does not imply  
  $\Using {\A} {\SF\cup\SF'}$, nor the other direction.
\james{would still like  a one sentence motivating/justifying ``with''.
Why do we need it}


\sdparagraph{Time: Next, Will, Prev, Was}
%
%\Chainmail 
We support several temporal operators familiar from temporal
logic ($\Next \A$, and $\Future \A$, and  $\Prev \A$, and $\Past \A$) to
talk about the future or the past in one or any number of steps.
%We support birectional temporal
%assertions, constraining either future ($\Future \A$. $\Next \A$)
%or past behaviour ($\Past \A$.  $\Prev \$A$) either considering only
%the  immediate next or immediate previous step ($\Next \A$,
%$\Prev \$A$) or for conditions that become eventually true in some
%distant future, or were true once in some distant past  
%($\Future \A$, $\Past \A$). We have bidirectional pairs of operators
%to give expressiveness in writing assertions: this does not offer any
%additional reasoning power. 
The assertion $\Future \A$ expresses that after one or more execution steps 
$\A$ will hold. For example, if the code being executed in $\sigma_2$ was 
method $\prg{m()}$ with receiver $\pu_{94}$,  and if $\sigma_2(\prg{94},\f_1)=\prg{2}$ and
$\sigma_2(\prg{94},\f_2)=\prg{93}$, and calling   \prg{m2} on \prg{93} returns \prg{4},
 and the body of \prg{m} was \prg{this}.$\f_1$.\prg{deposit(}\prg{\this.}$\f_2$.\prg{m2()},\prg{4.00}\prg{)},then\\
 $\strut$ \hspace{1.1cm}  $\M_{BA2}\mkpair ..., \sigma_2 \ \models \ \Future{ \Changes {\acc_2.\bal}}$.\sophia{It would
 be nice to have a simpler example; what makes it difficult is the fact that $\M_{AB2}$-internal transitions are
 not registered.}
 
\sdparagraph{Viewpoint: --  External}
%% The assertion $\Changes{\prg{e}}$  holds when the value of {\prg{e}}
%% in the next configuration is different to the value in the current configuration.
%% For example, if the code being executed in $\sigma_1$ started with $\acc_2.\bal=\acc_2.\bal+\prg{100.00}$, then:\\
%%   $\strut$ \hspace{1.1cm}  $..., \sigma_1 \ \models \  \Changes {\acc_2.\bal}$.\\

The assertion $\External {\prg{e}}$ expresses that the object {\prg{e}} does not belong to the module under consideration. 
  For example, \\
$\strut$ \hspace{1.1cm}  $\M_{AB2}\mkpair ..., \sigma_2 \ \models \ \External{\pu_{92}}$,
%$\strut$ 
\hspace{1cm}  $\M_{AB2}\mkpair ..., \sigma_2 \ \not\models \ \External{\acc_2}$, \\
$\strut$
 \hspace{1.1cm}  $\M_{AB2}\mkpair ..., \sigma_2 \ \not\models \ \External{\pb_{1}.\prg{ledger}}$\\
Notice the use of the \emph{internal} module, $\M_{AB2}$, needed to judge which objects are internal, and which are external.
 


%\sophia{The observer pattern example is very nice, but unfortunately we cannot use it, because the
%calls are internal, and therefore not visible in the current system.}
%For example, a part of the observer pattern is that when
%a subject is notified of a change, then the observer must
%be told to update itself.    We can write this from the
%subject's perspective, looking forwards:
%
%\begin{lstlisting}
%  Call(_,subject,notify,_) --> Will(Call(subject,observer,update,_))
%\end{lstlisting}
%
%\noindent meaning that once notify is called on a subejct, then its
%observer will be updated sometime in the future.  We can write a very
%similar specification for an observer, looking backwards.
%
%\begin{lstlisting}
%  Call(subject,observer,update,_) --> Was(Call(_,subject,notify,_))
%\end{lstlisting}
%
%\noindent meaning that if a subject updates an observer, that subject
%have been notified sometime previously. We could tighten each
%specifaction, so that the update must immediately follow the
%notification, by replacing $\Future \A$ or $\Past \A$ with 
%$\Next \A$ or $\Prev \A$.

\sdparagraph{Putting these together} We now look at some composite assertions which use ingredients
from several families from above. The assertion below says that if the call to be made next is $\pu_{94}$.\m\prg{()},
then the balance of $\acc_2$ will eventually change:\\
 $\strut$ \hspace{1.1cm}  $\M_{BA2}\mkpair ..., \sigma_2 \ \models \ {\Calls {..} {\pu_{94}} {\m} {()}}  \longrightarrow \Future{ \Changes {\acc_2.\bal}}$.\sophia{some delicate issues with $\sigma_2$ as used in prev. paragraph, where we already assumed that
 the code in $\sigma_2$ started with $\pu_{94}$.\m\prg{()} -- what can we do?}

We now add space to the mix, and demonstrate that in general $\Future {\Using {\A} {\SF}}$ is different from 
  $\Using {\Future {\A}} {\SF}$. Consider $\SF_1$ consisting of objects \prg{1}, \prg{2}, \prg{4}, \prg{93}, and \prg{94}, 
  and $\SF_2$ consisting of objects \prg{1}, \prg{2}, \prg{4}. Assume also that $\sigma_1$ contained the 
  call $\prg{m()}$ with receiver $\pu_{94}$,   that the code of \prg{m} and \prg{m2} were as above. Then\\
  $\strut$ \hspace{1.1cm}  $\M_{BA1}\mkpair ..., \sigma_1 \ \models \ \Using {\Future{ \Changes {\acc_2.\bal}}} {\SF_1}$\\ 
   $\strut$ \hspace{1.1cm}  $\M_{BA1}\mkpair ..., \sigma_1 \ \not\models \ \Using {\Future{ \Changes {\acc_2.\bal}}} {\SF_2}$\\ 
 $\strut$ \hspace{1.1cm}  $\M_{BA1}\mkpair ..., \sigma_1 \ \models \ \Future{ \Using {\Changes {\acc_2.\bal}} {\SF_2}}$\
