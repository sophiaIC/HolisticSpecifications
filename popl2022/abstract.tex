Robust modules guarantee to do \emph{only} what they are supposed to
do -- even in the presence of untrusted, malicious clients,
and considering not just the direct behaviour of individual methods,
but also the emergent behaviour from calls to more than one method. 
\Nec is a language for specifying robustness, based on novel necessity
operators capturing temporal implication, and a 
proof logic that derives explicit robustness specifications from
\funcSpecs. Soundness
and an exemplar proof
%are mechanised in Coq.
