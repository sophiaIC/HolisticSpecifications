\section{Outline of our approach}
\label{s:outline}
We now give an outline of our approach using a bank account example,   where funds may be transferred between accounts only if the account's password has been supplied.


 \subsection{Bank Account -- three modules}
\label{s:bank}
  
Module \prg{Mod1}   consists   of classes  \prg{Password} and  \prg{Account}
with a method called \prg{transfer}:
%
% (Note that we assume private fields are accessible ``class-wide''.)
%
% (methods may read and write fields of any instance of a class)
%
%and that passwords are unforgeable and not enumerable (again as
%in Java, albeit without reflection).
%
% 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Chainmail, frame=lines]
module Mod1
  class Account
    field balance:int 
    field pwd: Password
    method transfer(dest:Account, pwd':Object) -> void
      if this.pwd==pwd'
        this.balance-=100
        dest.balance+=100
  class Password
\end{lstlisting}
%
\noindent 
\susan[]{We can capture the intended
semantics of % the \prg{transfer} method 
\prg{transfer} % by writing
through a pre and postcondition JML-style\cite{Leavens-etal07}  ``classical''
specification, with universally quantified variables.}
\prg{Mod1}'s implementation of the \prg{transfer} method meets
this specification.



\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape=true, frame=lines, language=Chainmail]
ClassicBankSpec  $\triangleq$
   method transfer(dest:Account, pwd':Password) -> void {
       ( PRE:  this.balance=bal1 $\wedge$ this.pwd==pwd' $\wedge$ dest.balance=bal2 $\wedge$ dest=/=this 
         POST: this.balance == bal1-100 $\wedge$  dest.balance == bal2+100 )
       ( PRE: this.balance=bal1 $\wedge$ this.pwd=/=pwd' $\wedge$ dest.balance=bal2
         POST: this.balance == bal1 $\wedge$  dest.balance=bal2 )
       ( PRE: a : Account $\wedge$ a=/=this $\wedge$ a=/=dest  $\wedge$ a.balance=bal $\wedge$ a.pwd=pwd1
         POST:  a.balance=bal $\wedge$ a.pwd=pwd1)
       ( PRE: a : Account $\wedge$ a.pwd=pwd1  
         POST: a.pwd=pwd1)       
\end{lstlisting}
%\footnote{Perhaps omit some of the lines here, but we do need them all in the full discussion}
 
 

Now consider the following alternative implementations:
\prg{Mod2} allows any client to reset its password at any time, while
\prg{Mod3} first requires the existing password in order to change it.

%% The method \prg{transfer} in all three versions of the class \prg{Account} satisfies the (ClassicSpec), 
%% however, while executing the first and third version of \prg{Account} won't exhibit unwanted behaviour, the second version doesn't preclude it.
%Namely version II allows any client to change the password of the
%account, and then to repeatedly withdraw money from it.

  
% On the other hand, we expect our software -- even if complex -- to provide some simple, high level
%guarantees, e.g. email addressed to me personally will not be read by a third party unless I explicitly 
%forwarded it to them.
%We except  our software to  behave correctly, even when used by a careless or malicious third party. 
%Such use of a software often consist of a sequence of actions performed on the module. 
%
%Software components respond to single actions, 
%or to sequences of such single actions. 
%When thinking about a software component we want think about the behaviour of each 
%action in isolation, but also about the \emph{emergent behaviour}, ie all
% the possible effects of the combinations of these actions. 
  
  

\begin{tabular}{lll}
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.35\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=chainmail, frame=lines]
module Mod2
  class Account
    field balance:int 
    field pwd: Password 
    method transfer(..) 
      ... as earlier ...
    method set(pwd': Object)
      this.pwd=pwd'
      
  class Password
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
&\ \ \  \ \   &%
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.50\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=chainmail, frame=lines]
module Mod3
  class Account
    field balance:int 
    field pwd: Password 
    method transfer(..) 
      ... as earlier ...
    method set(pwd',pwd'': Object)
      if (this.pwd==pwd') 
        this.pwd=pwd''
  class Password
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage} 
\end{tabular}

Although the \prg{transfer} method is the same in
all three alternatives, and each one satisfies \prg{(ClassicBankSpec)},
code such as
%
\prg{account.set(42); account.transfer(yours, 42)}
%
are enough to drain the account in \prg{Mod2} without knowing the password.


 \subsection{Bank Account -- the right specification}

We need to rule out \prg{Mod2} while permitting \prg{Mod1} and
\prg{Mod3}. The catch is the vulnerability present in \prg{Mod2} is the result
of  \emph{emergent} behaviour from the interactions of the \prg{set}
and \prg{transfer} methods --- even though \prg{Mod3} also has a
\prg{set} method, it does not exhibit the unwanted interaction.
This is exactly where a necessary condition can help:
we want to avoid transferring money
(or more generally, reducing an account's balance)
\textit{without} the existing account password.  Phrasing the same condition
the other way around % gives us a positive statement that still
rules out the theft: that money \textit{can only} be
transferred when the account's password is known.
In \Nec  syntax:

%
%% The flaw in version {\sf{II}} arises from 
%% can be used to overwrite the
%% password, and then using the new password \prg{transfer}  can be called.
% If we want the \prg{Account} class to be robust, we must prohibit the password from being freely available.
%
%
%% In this paper, we show how \textit{necessity specifications} can solve
%% this progkem.  
%%  Therefore, we propose a %holistic 
%%  specification which says that
%%  the \prg{balance} of an \prg{Account} reduces only if an object which does not belong to the
%%  module has access to the password:
%
%
 %% Therefore, we propose a %holistic 
 %% specification which says that
 %% the \prg{balance} of an \prg{Account} reduces only if an object which does not belong to the
 %% module has access to the password:
%
\begin{lstlisting}[language = Chainmail, mathescape=true, frame=lines]
NecessityBankSpec  $\triangleq$   from a:Account $\wedge$ a.balance==bal
                        to a.balance < bal
                        onlyIf $\exists$ o.[$\external{\texttt{o}}$ $\wedge$ $\access{\texttt{o}}{\texttt{a.pwd}}$]
\end{lstlisting}
%
%
% 
%% In more detail, the specification from above says that if in the current
%% configuration \prg{a} is an \prg{Account},
%% and in some future configuration \prg{a} will have a balance less than the current one, then,in the \emph{current} configuration
%% there must exist some object \prg{o}, which is \emph{external} to our module (does not belong to module
 %% \prg{AccountMdl}), and which has access to \prg{a}'s password.
 %
%% T9hu having access to the password is a necessary condition for the balance to reduce.
The critical point of this \Nec specification is that it is
expressed in terms of observable effects and the shape of the heap --- the account's balance is reduced 
and there is external access to the password ($\external{\prg{o}}\ \wedge\ \access{\prg{o}}{\prg{a.pwd}}$)
--- and not in terms of individual methods --- such as
\prg{set} or \prg{transfer}.
This gives our specifications the
vital advantage that they constrain
\textit{implementation} of a bank account with a balance and a
password, irrespective of the API it
offers, the services it exports, or the dependencies on other parts of
the system.

%\sophiaPonder[skip that part?]
{This example also demonstrates that 
%the specification need  refer  to  individual methods in a module.
%Moreover, 
adherence to   \Nec specifications is not monotonic:
Adding a method to a module does not necessarily preserve adherence to a specification.
And while separate methods may adhere to a  specification, their combination does
not necessarily do so. Thus, \Nec specifications capture a module's \emph{emergent behaviour}. 
}

%\jm[TODO: in the proof later we need to mention that there is a difference between the overall proof (no mention of the methods), and the intermediate ones (that do mention the methods)]{}


%\subsection{Internal and External Modules, Objects, and Calls}

\subsection{Internal and External objects and calls}
\label{s:concepts}

Our work concentrates on guarantees made for the \emph{open} setting; that is, a given module
$M$ is programmed in such a robust manner
%\sophia[We had agreed no to say "robust", but I think it is OK here. Alternatively, say defensively robust?]{}
 that execution of $M$ together with \emph{any} \externalM 
module $M'$ will uphold these guarantees. In the tradition of
visible states semantics, we are  only interested in upholding the guarantees while 
$M'$, the  \externalM module,  is executing.   
 We therefore distinguish between \emph{\internalO} and
\emph{\externalO} objects: those that belong to classes defined in $M$, and the rest. Similarly, we 
distinguish between \emph{\internalC} calls, i.e. calls made % from \externalO objects
 to \internalO objects, and \emph{\externalC} calls, i.e. calls made % from \externalC objects
 to \externalC objects. % We are less
% interested in calls made from \internalO objects to \internalO objects, because we only need 
% establish the guarantees when the \externalM module is executing. And we 


Moreover, because we only require that the guarantees are upheld while 
  the  \externalM module  is executing, we develop an \emph{external states} semantics, where
 any internal calls are executed in one, large, step.
 Note that we do not -- yet -- support calls from
\internalO objects to \externalO objects.\sophia[we need to think where our system forbids that, ... ?]{} 
 With external steps semantics,  the executing object (the \prg{this}) is always   external. 
 


\subsection{Reasoning about Necessity}
\label{s:approach}
 
The proof that \prg{Mod3} adheres to \prg{NecessityBankSpec} consists,
broadly, of the following parts:


\begin{description}
\item[Part 1] We establish that  \textbf{(a)} the balance may only change through  
\prg{Mod3}-internal calls.
Also,  \textbf{(b)},   external accessibility to an account's password may 
only be obtained through  \prg{Mod3}-internal calls -- that is,  the property that
no external object has access to the password can only be invalidated through an internal call.
 
\item[Part 2] We establish  for each method of \prg{Mod3} (i.e. each method in \prg{Account} and \prg{Password}) that if the method is called, then 
 \textbf{(c)},  if it  causes the  balance to reduce, then the method called was
 \prg{transfer} and the correct password was provided, and 
  \textbf{(d)} it will not provide external accessibility to the password.

 \item[Part 3]  From \textbf{(a)}  and  \textbf{(c)} we obtain that \textbf{(e)}  if the balance were to 
reduce in \emph{any}  \emph{single} step -- whether an internal call, or any external step --
 the method called was
 \prg{transfer} and the correct password was provided. Similarly,   from
 \textbf{(b)}  and  \textbf{(d)} we obtain that \textbf{(f)}
 external accessibility to the password will not be provided by any single step.
    
 
\item[Part 4] From \textbf{(e)} we obtain that  \textbf{(g)}   if the balance reduces in any 
number of steps, then at some step  \prg{transfer} was called with   the correct password.
From  \textbf{(g)}  we obtain that \textbf{(h)} if the balance reduces in any 
number of steps, then at some intermediate step some external object had access to the password.
From \textbf{(f)} we obtain that  \textbf{(i)}  external accessibility to the password will not be provided by any sequence of steps.
Using  \textbf{(h)} and  \textbf{(i)}  we establish that
 \prg{Mod3} indeed adheres to \prg{NecessityBankSpec}.

\end{description} 
 
\noindent
We  now outline  the  formal concepts and ideas used in the four parts   from above:

\begin{description}
\item[Part 1] 
We  say assertion $A$  is
\emph{encapsulated} by  module $M$, if  $A$ can be invalidated only through
  $M$-\internalC calls. In short, an $M$-\internalC call is a \emph{necessary} condition for
invalidation of $A$.
% In \textbf{P1}, the assertion \prg{a:Account\! $\wedge$\! a.balance=bal} is encapsulated by \prg{Mod3}.

Determining encapsulation is a challenge, but not central to this work.
We therefore outline a rudimentary types-based algorithm, and relegate more
approaches to further work.
  
\item[Part 2]
 Here we infer a \emph{per-method-condition}, i.e., a 
 necessary condition given an effect and
a single, specified, method call. 
% 
%In \textbf{P2},   a necessary condition for the  reduction of \prg{a.balance}  after the call \prg{a.transfer(a',pwd)} is that the caller had access to \prg{a.password} before the call.

We address this  challenge % of the inference of necessary conditions 
 by leveraging the sufficient conditions from classical specifications:
If the negation of a method's
 classical postcondition implies  the effect we are interested in, then the negation of the 
 classical precondition  is the necessary precondition for the effect and the method call.
 \jm[]{Note, this step is the only time we need to inspect method bodies, and this is only
 done in so far as it is needed to prove classical specifications.}
More in \S\ref{s:classical-proof}.  
 % Thus, 
 %  a method's sufficient conditions are used to infer a method's and effect's necessary conditions.



  
%\item[from effect and single step to necessary condition]
\item[Part 3]
Here we infer a \emph{per-step-condition}, i.e., a 
 necessary condition given an effect and
a single, unspecified step. This step could be an internal call, or any kind of external step.

%In \textbf{P3},   a necessary condition for the  reduction of \prg{a.balance}  after \emph{any}
%step, is that the caller  had access to \prg{a.password} before the call.
%And similarly in \textbf{P4},   a necessary condition for an external object's
%access to \prg{a.password}  after \emph{any}
%step, is that that object had access to \prg{a.password} before the call.

For effects encapsulated by $M$, we can infer such one-step
necessary conditions by combining the necessary conditions for that effect from 
all   methods in $M$. We also have  expected sub-structural rules, \emph{e.g.,} 
 like the rule of consequence.
More in \S\ref{s:module-proof}.



%\item[from effect to necessary conditions]
\item[Part 4]
  
We now infer the \emph{emergent} behaviour out of the many possible 
single steps.  This part is crucial;   remember that while \prg{Mod2} satisfies  
(***) for one single step, it does not satisfy it for any number of steps. More in \S\ref{s:emergent-proof}.
 
\end{description}
