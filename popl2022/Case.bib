This paper describes the goals and architecture of the Spec# programming system, consisting of the object-oriented Spec# programming language, the Spec# compiler, and the Boogie static program verifier. The language includes constructs for writing specifications that capture programmer intentions about how methods and data are to be used, the compiler emits run-time checks to enforce these specifications, and the verifier can check the consistency between a program and its specifications.},

abstract = {Security-preserving compilers generate compiled code that withstands target-level
attacks such as alteration of control flow, data leaks, or memory corruption. Many
existing security-preserving compilers are proven to be fully abstract, meaning that
they reflect and preserve observational equivalence. Fully abstract compilation is
strong and useful but, in certain cases, comes at the cost of requiring expensive
runtime constructs in compiled code. These constructs may have no relevance for security,
but are needed to accommodate differences between the source and target languages
that fully abstract compilation necessarily needs.As an alternative to fully abstract
compilation, this article explores a different criterion for secure compilation called
robustly safe compilation or RSC. Briefly, this criterion means that the compiled
code preserves relevant safety properties of the source program against all adversarial
contexts interacting with the compiled program. We show that RSC can be proved more
easily than fully abstract compilation and also often results in more efficient code.
We also present two different proof techniques for establishing that a compiler attains
RSC and, to illustrate them, develop three illustrative robustly safe compilers that
rely on different target-level protection mechanisms. We then proceed to turn one
of our compilers into a fully abstract one and through this example argue that proving
RSC can be simpler than proving full abstraction.To better explain and clarify notions,
this article uses syntax highlighting in a way that colourblind and black-8-white
readers can benefit from Reference [58]. For a better experience, please print or
