\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:conclusion}

%Bad things can happen to good programs. In an open world, every
%accessible API is an attack surface: and every combination of
%API calls is a potential attack.  Developers can no longer just consider
%components in splendid isolation, verifying sufficient pre and
%postconditions of each method, but must reckon with the emergent
%behaviour of entire software systems. Programmers
%must identify the necessary conditions under which anything could
%happen \cite{anything} --- good things and bad things alike --- and
%ensure the necessary conditions for bad things happening never arise.


%% A module written to be used with other code needs to ensure that no
%% other code may use it and cause unintended effects.
%% Developers whose
%% modules are going to be used in the wild, need the language to
%% constrain the usage of their code, and the capability to prove that
%% their code will always meet these constraints.

%This paper defines \Nec, which takes an holistic view of modules.
This paper presents 
\Nec, a specification language for a program's
emergent behaviour.
\Nec specifications
constrain when effects can happen in some future state
(``\texttt{\color{blue}onlyIf} ''),
in the immediately following state (``\texttt{\color{blue}next}''), or
on an execution path 
(``\texttt{\color{blue}onlyThrough}'').

%\Nec treats program effects as actions:
%that is, as transitions from states satisfying some assertion 
%$A_1$ to other states satisfying assertions $A_2$. 
%% \Nec specifications then permit those transitions
%% only if some other assertion $A_3$ holds beforehand;
%% or only if $A_3$ holds and $A_2$ is reached in a single step;
%% or only if $A_3$ holds at some point on the path between
%%$A_1$ and $A_2$.
%% \susan[This called the assertion language A - should it be Basicspec or just skip the name as I have done?]{}
%% The assertion language supports the usual expressions about the
%% values of variables, the contents of the heap, and predicates
%% to capture provenance and permission.

%% doesn't need to be said here
%%
%% Modules can satisfy Necessity Specifications only if
%% the underlying programming language and the runtime system 
%% can give some basic guarantees:
%% memory safety (addresses cannot be forged), 
%% and some notion of privacy (here fields are module-private, i.e. can be read and written only
%% by methods of the same module). Different notions of privacy 
%% (e.g. fields to be class-private,
%% or object-private, and fields to be private only if explicitly defined to be so)  would
%% also be sufficient to develop code that satisfies such Necessity
%% Specifications.
 
We have developed a proof system to prove that modules meet their specifications.  Our proof system exploits the
pre and
postconditions of classical method specifications to infer per method \Nec specifications, 
generalises those to cover any single execution step,
and then combines them to capture a program's emergent behaviour.
%
%% By
%% combining single step specifications, programs can describe
%% components' emergent behaviour --- i.e. the necessary conditions for
%% program effects, irrespective of how that effect is caused.
%% Finally,

%
Deriving per method \Nec specifications from classical specifications
has two advantages. First, we
did not need to develop a special purpose logic for that task. Second,
modules that have simillar classical 
specifications can be proven to satisfy the same Necessity
Specifications using the \emph{same} proof.
%
%
We have proved our system sound, and used it to
prove a bank account example correct: the Coq mechanisation is
detailed in the appendices and available as an artifact.

%
%% these describe the necessary conditions for given effects
%% which take place after the execution of a known method call. 
%% Per-method Necessity Specifications can be generalized to one-step
%%  Necessity Specifications; these describe necessary conditions for
%%  given effects  which take place after the execution of one, 
%%  unknown, single, step. 
%%  Lastly, one-step
%% Necessity Specifications are combined with other \NecessitySpecifications
%%  to describe the emergent behaviour, ie  necessary conditions for some effect which
%%  may have taken place over many, unknown, internal or external steps.

%%the following feels like discussions but I reworded a biut.
%
%

%% For instance, the
%% modules \prg{Mod1} and \prg{Mod3} from the introduction, and also
%% module \jm[]{\ModD} from Sec. \ref{s:examples} satisfy
%% \prg{NecessityBankSpec}.  The proofs for these three modules differ
%% slightly in the proof of encapsulation of the assertion
%% \prg{a.password=pwd} (step \textbf(A)} in Sec. \ref{s:examples}),
%%   and in the proof of the per-method \Nec specification for
%%   \prg{transfer}, but otherwise are identical.


%%the following feels like discussions but I reworded a bit but...


%Our formalisation of \Nec has a number of limitations that should be
% addressed in future work.
\sd{In future work we want to expand a Hoare logic so as to make use of
\Nec specifications, and reason about calls into unknown code
- c.f. \S \ref{sec:how}. 
We want to remove the current requirement for  explicit
framing, and leverage instead some   of \prg{modifies}-clauses or implicit dynamic frames
\cite{Leavens-etal07x,IshtiaqOHearn01,IDF,MattAlex,dafny13}.
% could make the proofs more convenient.
\sophiaPonder[I shopped, as do not understand "A bespoke program logic could make it easier to derive 
\Nec from classical specifications."]
We want to work on supporting callbacks.
%Our Coq formalisation is parametric with respect to assertion
% satisfaction, encapsulation, and the type system. 
We want to develop a logic for encapsulation rather than rely on a type system.
Finally we want to develop logics about reaoning about risk and trust \cite{swapsies}.
}
% SD also removed the below, as do not agree
% A better integrated model of
% encapsulation should let us remove these restrictions.

%% We considered developing a bespoke logic to infer per method \Nec
%% specifications.  Such a logic might be more powerful than the
%% \Nec \jm[]{proof} system; we aim to consider that in further work.
%% Moreover, the classical specifications we are using to infer the per
%% method \Nec specifications are very ``basic'', and thus they need
%% to explicitly state what has not been modified -- this makes proofs
%%  cumbersome. In future work, we plan to start from classical
%% specifications which have more information about the affected part of
%% the state (e.g. using \prg{modifies}-clauses, or implicit frames
%% \cite{Leavens-etal07x,IshtiaqOHearn01,IDF,MattAlex,dafny13}) as we expect this could
%% make the step from classical specifications to per method \Nec
%% specifications more convenient.

%% Our \jm[]{proof} system is parametric with an algorithmic judgment which
%% can prove that an assertion is encapsulated. In this paper we have
%% used a rudimentary, type-based \jm[]{proof} system, but we aim to develop
%% a logic for inferring such assertions. The concept of encapsulation in
%% this work is very coarse, and based on the classes of objects. In the
%% future, we plan to refine our handling of encapsulation, and support
%% reasoning about more flexible configurations of objects.  Similarly,
%% to facilitate the formal treatment, we currently forbid internal
%% objects to call into external objects: we hope a better model of
%% encapsulation will let us remove this restriction.


%To conclude: bad things can always happen to good programs. \Nec
%specifications are necessary to make sure good programs don't do bad
%things in response.
