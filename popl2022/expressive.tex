\subsection{Expressiveness of Necessity Specifications}

\susan[]{Chainmail \cite{FASE} was guided by a study of a sequence of exemplars from the object-capability literature and the smart contracts world. We show that \Chainmail is suitable for specifying them too.}

\subsubsection{ERC20}
The ERC20 is a widely used token standard describing the basic functionality of any Ethereum-based token 
contract. This functionality includes issuing tokens, keeping track of tokens belonging to participants, and the 
transfer of tokens between participants. Tokens may only be transferred if there are sufficient tokens in the 
participant's account, and if either they or someone authorized the participant initiated the transfer. We 
specify these necessary conditions here using \Chainmail and the Logic of Necessity. Firstly, \prg{ERC20Spec1} 
says that if the balance of a participant's account is ever reduced by some amount $m$, then
that must have occurred as a result of a call to the \prg{transfer} method with amount $m$ by the participant,
or the \prg{transferFrom} method with the amount $m$ by some other participant.
\begin{lstlisting}[language = Chainmail, mathescape=true, frame=lines]
ERC20Spec1 $\triangleq$ from e : ERC20 $\wedge$ e.balance(p) = m + m' $\wedge$ m > 0
              to1 e.balance(p) = m'
              onlyIf $\exists$ p', p''.[$\calls{\prg{p}}{\prg{e}}{\prg{transfer}}{\prg{p', m}}$ $\vee$ $\calls{\prg{p''}}{\prg{e}}{\prg{transferFrom}}{\prg{p', m}}$]
\end{lstlisting}
Secondly, \prg{ERC20Spec2} specifies under what circumstances some participant \prg{p'} is authorized to 
spend \prg{m} tokens on behalf of \prg{p}: either \prg{p} approved \prg{p'}, \prg{p'} was previously authorized,
or \prg{p'} was authorized for some amount \prg{m + m'}, and spent \prg{m'}.
\begin{lstlisting}[language = Chainmail, mathescape=true, frame=lines]
ERC20Spec2 $\triangleq$ from e : ERC20 $\wedge$ p : Object $\wedge$ p' : Object $\wedge$ m : Nat
              to1 e.allowed(p, p') = m
              onlyIf $\calls{\prg{p}}{\prg{e}}{\prg{approve}}{\prg{p', m}}$ $\vee$ 
                     (e.allowed(p, p') = m $\wedge$ 
                      $\neg$ ($\calls{\prg{p'}}{\prg{e}}{\prg{transferFrom}}{\prg{p, \_}}$ $\vee$ 
                              $\calls{\prg{p}}{\prg{e}}{\prg{allowed}}{\prg{p, \_}}$)) $\vee$
                     $\exists$ p''. [e.allowed(p, p') = m + m' $\wedge$ $\calls{\prg{p'}}{\prg{e}}{\prg{transferFrom}}{\prg{p'', m'}}$]
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{DAO}
The Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a well-known Ethereum contract allowing 
participants to invest funds. The DAO famously was exploited with a re-entrancy bug in 2016, 
and lost \$50M. Here we provide specifications that would have secured the DAO against such a 
bug. \prg{DAOSpec1} says that no participant's balance may ever exceed the ether remaining 
in DAO.
\begin{lstlisting}[language = Chainmail, mathescape=true, frame=lines]
DAOSpec1 $\triangleq$ from d : DAO
            to d.balance(p) > d.ether
            onlyIf false
\end{lstlisting}
The second specification \prg{DAOSpec2} states that if a participant's balance is \prg{m}, then 
either this occurred as a result of joining the DAO with an initial investment of \prg{m}, or the
balance is \prg{0}, and they've just withdrawn their funds.
\begin{lstlisting}[language = Chainmail, mathescape=true, frame=lines]
DAOSpec2 $\triangleq$ from d : DAO
            to1 d.balance(p) = m
            onlyIf $\calls{\prg{p}}{\prg{d}}{\prg{repay}}{\prg{\_}}$ $\wedge$ m = 0 $\vee$ $\calls{\prg{p}}{\prg{d}}{\prg{join}}{\prg{m}}$ $\vee$ d.balance(p) = m
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{DOM}
The Domain Object Model (DOM) is the representation of the objects comprising a web document.
The DOM has a recursive tree structure.

\prg{DOMSpec} states that if the property of a node in a DOM tree changes,
it follows that either some non-node, non-wrapper object presently has 
access to a node of the DOM tree, or to some wrapper with access to some 
ancestor of the node that was modified.
\begin{lstlisting}[language = Chainmail, mathescape=true, frame=lines]
DOMSpec $\triangleq$ from nd : Node $\wedge$ n.property = p
            to nd.property != p
            onlyIf $\exists$ o.[$\neg$ o : Node $\wedge$ $\neg$ o : Wrapper $\wedge$ 
                        ($\exists$ nd' : Node.[$\access{\prg{o}}{\prg{nd'}}$] $\vee$ 
                         $\exists$ w : Wrapper, k : $\mathbb{N}$.[$\access{\prg{o}}{\prg{w}}$ $\wedge$ nd.parnt$^{\prg{k}}$ = w.node.parnt$^{\prg{w.height}}$] )]
\end{lstlisting}
