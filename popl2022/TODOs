TODOs

1. Intro: write the related work at top of page 2						 -------------- kjx
2. Where does Dreyer et al 2020 go to								-------------- kjx
3. revisit section 2, and use the correct terminology  						-------------- kjx
4. Deal with the blue annots is section 3 -- mostly read the foornotes and agree and remove ============== julian
4a. ?? Add the external steps diagram from FASE?                                            ============== julian
5. Write the reflection on why Def. 3.4 is useful (perhaps take from FASE)                  ============== julian
6. Lemma 3.5 has problems, as we said                                                       ============== julian
7. Check that ocurrences of SpecX and SpecW are correct                                     ============== julian
8. Improve motivation for Def. 3.6, and give some example (again, perhaps FASE has got this)============== julian
9. Lemma 3.9 has two problems; fix, and turn into a Def, or an Axiom; EXPLAIN that we _assume_ the existence of the algorithmic system ========== julian
10.Section 3.5 -- is that clear as is?                                                      ============== julian
11. ?? Add diagram for DAO from FASE?
12. Sophia to read section 4. in particular, there is no $C$ for code as in the Hoare triples  ========= SOPHIA
13. Add Def of Wrapped, and add explanations                                                ============== julian (argh! I thought I did this!)
14. Soundess Theorem (4.1) fix the statement. We cannot assume more conditions in the proof.  ========= SOPHIA
15. Continue writing the conclusion ========= SOPHIA
16. Make sure we say about fields being protected, and say also at which point this is important  -------------- kjx
17. Make sure we way that we do not have calls from internal to external, and also say also at which point this is important -------------- kjx
18. Do we explain anywhere why a.balance=val is encapsulated? -------------- kjx



If we have time, 
T1. some of the Conclusion should go to earlier
T2. Add some examplesbefore we hit section 5
T3. Show the example of something that is not encapsulated
