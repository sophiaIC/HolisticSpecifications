TODOs

1. Intro: write the related work at top of page 2
2. Where does Dreyer et al 2020 go to
3. revisit section 2, and use the correct terminology
4. Deal with the blue annots is section 3 -- mostly read the foornotes and agrre and remove
4a. ?? Add the external steps diagram from FASE?
5. Write the reflection on why Def. 3.4 is useful (perhaps take from FASE)
6. Lemma 3.5 has problems, as we said
7. Check that ocurrences of SpecX and SpecW are correct
8. Improve motivation for Def. 3.6, and give some example (again, perhaps FASE has got this)
9. Lemma 3.9 has two problems; fix, and turn into a Def, or an Axiom; EXPLAIN that we _assume_ the existence of the algorithmic system
10.Section 3.5 -- is that clear as is? 
11. ?? Add diagram for DAO from FASE?
12. Sophia to read section 4. in particular, there is no $C$ for code as in the Hoare triples
13. Add Def of Wrapped, and add explanations
14. Soundess Theorem (4.1) fix the statement. We cannot assume more conditions in the proof.
15. Continue writing the conclusion
16. Make sure we say about fields being protected, and say also at which point this is important
17. Make sure we way that we do not have calls from internal to external, and also say also at which point this is important


If we have time, 
T1. some of the Conclusion should go to earlier
