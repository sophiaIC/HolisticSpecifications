-------------------------------------------------------

Dear James,

You have already received the comments by the reviewers in a previous
email. Please take them carefully into account when preparing your
camera-ready paper for the proceedings.
The camera-ready version and the signed copyright form are due on 

        February, 22nd, 2020.

Please note that this is a firm deadline for the production of the proceedings. 

You should submit your paper using your EasyChair proceedings
author role for FASE 2020.

1. FINAL PAPER: Please submit the files belonging to your
camera-ready paper using your EasyChair author account. Follow
the instructions after the login for uploading two files:

 (1) A zipped file containing all your LaTeX sources

 (2) the PDF version of your camera-ready paper

Research papers and empirical evaluation papers can have a maximum of 18 pp llncs.cls (excluding bibliography). Tool demonstration papers can have a maximum of 6 pp llncs.cls (including bibliography). Appendices are not allowed.  

Please follow strictly
the author instructions of Springer-Verlag when preparing the
final version:

Our publisher has recently introduced an extra control loop: once
data processing is finished, they will contact all corresponding
authors and ask them to check their papers. We expect this to
happen shortly before the printing of the proceedings. At that
time your quick interaction with Springer-Verlag will be greatly
appreciated.

2. COPYRIGHT: Please upload a signed and completed copyright form
to us as soon as possible. The Springer copyright forms can be
found at

 https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/15433008/data/Contract_Book_Contributor_Consent_to_Publish_LNCS_SIP

It is sufficient for one of the authors to sign the copyright
form. He or she signs for and accepts responsibility for releasing the material on behalf of any and all co-authors.You can scan the form into PDF or any other standard image format.


ORCIDs
======
Springer encourages that authors include their ORCID id. For more
information see: http://bit.ly/2H5xBpN.


Open access block
=================
The authors are required to include an open access text block completely
at the end of their paper, that is, following the references. This open
access block does not count for the page limit. You can see an
example here (at the end of the paper):

https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-17462-0_1.pdf

We will send you a LaTeX snippet producing this block once we've got it. Also, we may contact you again with additional information later on (some proceedings details are still being discussed with the rest of the ETAPS conferences) so start preparing the camera-ready version but keep an eye on potential further announcements. 

We greatly appreciate your cooperation in these matters. Thank
you again for your contribution to FASE 2020.


Sincerely,

Heike Wehrheim and Jordi Cabot
