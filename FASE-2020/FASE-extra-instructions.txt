Dear James,

Additional information to prepare your camera-ready paper (remember that the camera-ready version and the signed copyright form are due on February 22nd, 2020, this is a firm deadline for the production of the proceedings).

This email complements the information already provided in our previous email from January 15th.

Springer has sent us a LaTeX snippet for the Open Access block which is
to be included at the end (so following the references) of each paper in
the proceedings. The zip-file contains the LaTeX snippet,
as well as a sample file. You can download it from here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/71fof7ayjatez8n/llncs2e.zip?dl=0 

Springer further points out:

1. Any authors wishing to include their ORCIDs should insert the logo
and link this themselves before the papers are sent to us. The ORCID
logo is in the zip file attached. The sample paper shows how to include it.

2. All links in the papers should already be included in the PDF version.

3. The authors should include their own running heads.

4. All author affiliations must include at least the town and the country.

Regards

Heike and Jordi
