\maketitle

Functional specifications describe what
program components can do: the sufficient  conditions to
invoke a component's operations.
They allow us to reason about the  use  of  
components in  the closed world setting, where
the component interacts with known client code, and 
where the client code must establish the appropriate pre-conditions 
before calling into the component.
 
Sufficient conditions are not enough to reason about 
the use of components in the open world setting, where
the component interacts with external code, possibly of unknown
provenance, 
and where the  component itself may evolve over time. 
In this   open world  setting,
we must also consider the
 necessary conditions, i.e.
what are the conditions without which an effect will not happen. 

In this paper we
 propose the 
 language  Chainmail for writing holistic  specifications that
 focus on  necessary as well as sufficient conditions. We
 give a formal semantics for  Chainmail. The core of  Chainmail has been
mechanised in the Coq proof assistant.


\begin{abstract}
Functional specifications describe what
program components \emph{can} do: the \emph{sufficient} conditions to
invoke a component's operations.
They allow us to reason about the  use  of  
components in  the \emph{closed world} setting, where
the component interacts with known client code, and 
where the client code must establish the appropriate pre-conditions 
before calling into the component.
 
Sufficient conditions are not enough to reason about 
the use of components in the \emph{open world} setting, where
the component interacts with external code, possibly of unknown
provenance, 
and where the  component itself may evolve over time. 
In this   open world  setting,
we must also consider the
\emph{necessary} conditions, \ie
what are the conditions without which an effect will \emph{not} happen. 

In this paper we
 propose the 
 language \Chainmail for writing \emph{holistic} specifications that
 focus on necessary conditions (as well as sufficient conditions). We
 give a formal semantics for \Chainmail, and the core of \Chainmail has been
  mechanised in the Coq proof assistant.

\section{Overview of the Formal foundations}
\label{sect:formal}
We now give an overview of the formal model for \Chainmail. In section \ref{sect:overviewmodel} we 
introduce  the shape of the judgments used to give semantics to \Chainmail, while in section \ref{sect:PL} 
we describe the most salient aspects of an underlying programming language used in \Chainmail.

take from our earlier works

In two versions: one where there is a ledger inside the Mint, and one where the Mint has no path to the Purses. This will serve to demonstrate how \prg{internal} is supposed to work.

\subsection*{LATEX mysteries and terminology}
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item
 How can we make the references refer to the Definitions, Lemmas etc
 rather than the section where these appear?
 \begin{quotation}
   \color{orange} KJX:   Not sure what the problem is. I've put labels
   in the definitions and I can use refs to get definition
   numbers~\ref{defONE} and~\ref{def:syntax:classes} ---
   not ~\ref{secONE} and ~\ref{sec:syntax:classes}, the section
   numbers containing those definions.

   Alternatively there is the ``cleverer'' package
   \url{http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cleveref/cleveref.pdf}
   where a ``\verb+\cref{foo}+'' can generate both the type and the
   number e.g.  ``Definition 3''.
 \end{quotation}

 \item
 Need a nice metavariable for set of addresses, currently it is $R$. Perhaps instead use an enumeration, as eg $\{ \ \alpha_1,...\alpha_n\ \} $
 or $\kappa$?

 \begin{quotation}
 \color{orange} KJX: Hmm, the enumeration is fine. Otherwise $A$?
 $\mathcal{A}$?  Or we could call that set a ``footprint'' and so go
 with $F$ or $\mathcal{F}$\ldots
 \end{quotation}
\item
Find a nice term  to refer to module pairs  (internal, external), and a term for
our version visible states semantics.
 \begin{quotation}
   \color{orange} KJX: ``modules'' and ``modular state semantics''.
   Going to ``modules'' only makes sense with my answer below.
   Other permutations of
   ``visible module/modular state semantics'' work also work:
     modular visible state; visible modular state; etc\ldots
 \end{quotation}


\item
Better symbols for module linking (currently a $\M\link\M'$), and
for module pairing (currently a $\M\mkpair \M'$) -- perhaps there should not be such an operator, as
it does not create a new module, it is only used in execution ($\M\mkpair \M', \sigma \leadsto \sigma'$)
and in satisfaction of assertions ($\M\mkpair \M', \sigma\models \A$).
\footnote{\toby{TM: I like~$\M \mkpair \M'$ as it suggests the asymmetry of the visible
    state semantics wrt~$\M$ and~$\M'$.}}

 \begin{quotation}
   \color{orange} KJX: I'm so used to $\M\link\M'$ that I can't think
   of an alternative --- or do I recall we used $\M * \M'$ as a
   separating conjunction?

   So I really liked $\M\mkpair \M'$ --- except then I though that I
   couldn't remember which was the module (inside) and which the
   anti-module (the outside).  For some reason I thought outside would
   go first.  Then I realised, it's easy, cos $\M$ is always the
   module, and $\M'$ is the antimodule.

   At which point I though: OK so let's just write $\M$ as the module,
   and given any $\M$, then $\M'$ (or $\overline{\M}$ or I guess
   \textbf{out}($\M$)) for the antimodule.

   The only thing I think this loses is that the $\M\mkpair \M'$
   syntax, also like a separating conjunction, is sort of
   self-framing: $\M\mkpair \M'$ encompasses the universe of modules.
   Whereas the other way around, we'd need a (implicit) universe of
   all modules $\mathcal{U}$, and then define $\M' \triangleq
   \mathcal{U} - \M$  If we went with $\M'$ then Sophia couldn't use
   $\M''$ and friends --- have to write \texttt{N} and \texttt{O} for other
   modules?

   I think the only change I could see in the whole document was that
   lemma~\ref{lemma:module_pair_execution} is subsumed into
   lemma~\ref{lemma:linking:properties}.
