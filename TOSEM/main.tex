\begin{abstract}
Functional specifications describe what
program components \emph{can} do: the \emph{sufficient} conditions to
invoke components' operations.
They allow us to reason about the  use  of  
components in  a \emph{closed world} setting, where
components interact with known client code, and 
where the client code must establish the appropriate pre-conditions 
before calling into a component.

%don't start sentences with However!
Sufficient conditions are not enough to reason about 
the use of components in an \emph{open world} setting, where
components interact with external code, possibly of unknown
provenance, 
and where components may evolve over time. 
%
In this   open world  setting,
%%
%% we must also consider the
ensuring that your component is robust even when executing
 with buggy or malicious external code is critical.
 \emph{Holistic specifications}
--- as their name implies --- 
are concerned  with the \emph{overall} behaviour of a component,  in all possible 
interleavings of calls to the component's operations with those of the external code.
Thus, holistic specifications are concerned with \emph{sufficient} conditions, \ie
what is enough to \emph{cause} some effect, as well as with
\emph{necessary} conditions, \ie
what are the conditions without which an effect will \emph{not} happen. 
%

% New para. The previous was the problem, the current is what we do
In this paper we
%argue for the need for such holistic specifications,
 propose the 
 \Chainmail specification language for writing \emph{holistic} specifications that
 focus on necessary conditions (as well as sufficient conditions). We
 give a formal semantics for \Chainmail, and discuss several examples.
 The core of \Chainmail has been
  mechanised in the Coq proof assistant.
%% By adopting holistic specification techniques like \Chainmail,
%% programmers can explicitly define what their components should not do,
%% making it easier to write
%% robust and reliable programs.

\section{Overview of the Formal foundations}
\label{sect:formal}
We now give an overview of the formal model for \Chainmail. In section \ref{sect:overviewmodel} we 
introduce  the shape of the judgments used to give semantics to \Chainmail, while in section \ref{sect:PL} 
we describe the most salient aspects of an underlying programming language used in \Chainmail.

\subsection*{LATEX mysteries and terminology}
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item
 How can we make the references refer to the Definitions, Lemmas etc
 rather than the section where these appear?
 \begin{quotation}
   \color{orange} KJX:   Not sure what the problem is. I've put labels
   in the definitions and I can use refs to get definition
   numbers~\ref{defONE} and~\ref{def:syntax:classes} ---
   not ~\ref{secONE} and ~\ref{sec:syntax:classes}, the section
   numbers containing those definions.

   Alternatively there is the ``cleverer'' package
   \url{http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cleveref/cleveref.pdf}
   where a ``\verb+\cref{foo}+'' can generate both the type and the
   number e.g.  ``Definition 3''.
 \end{quotation}

 \item
 Need a nice metavariable for set of addresses, currently it is $R$. Perhaps instead use an enumeration, as eg $\{ \ \alpha_1,...\alpha_n\ \} $
 or $\kappa$?

 \begin{quotation}
 \color{orange} KJX: Hmm, the enumeration is fine. Otherwise $A$?
 $\mathcal{A}$?  Or we could call that set a ``footprint'' and so go
 with $F$ or $\mathcal{F}$\ldots
 \end{quotation}
\item
Find a nice term  to refer to module pairs  (internal, external), and a term for
our version visible states semantics.
 \begin{quotation}
   \color{orange} KJX: ``modules'' and ``modular state semantics''.
   Going to ``modules'' only makes sense with my answer below.
   Other permutations of
   ``visible module/modular state semantics'' work also work:
     modular visible state; visible modular state; etc\ldots
 \end{quotation}


\item
Better symbols for module linking (currently a $\M\link\M'$), and
for module pairing (currently a $\M\mkpair \M'$) -- perhaps there should not be such an operator, as
it does not create a new module, it is only used in execution ($\M\mkpair \M', \sigma \leadsto \sigma'$)
and in satisfaction of assertions ($\M\mkpair \M', \sigma\models \A$).
\footnote{\toby{TM: I like~$\M \mkpair \M'$ as it suggests the asymmetry of the visible
    state semantics wrt~$\M$ and~$\M'$.}}

 \begin{quotation}
   \color{orange} KJX: I'm so used to $\M\link\M'$ that I can't think
   of an alternative --- or do I recall we used $\M * \M'$ as a
   separating conjunction?

   So I really liked $\M\mkpair \M'$ --- except then I though that I
   couldn't remember which was the module (inside) and which the
   anti-module (the outside).  For some reason I thought outside would
   go first.  Then I realised, it's easy, cos $\M$ is always the
   module, and $\M'$ is the antimodule.

   At which point I though: OK so let's just write $\M$ as the module,
   and given any $\M$, then $\M'$ (or $\overline{\M}$ or I guess
   \textbf{out}($\M$)) for the antimodule.

   The only thing I think this loses is that the $\M\mkpair \M'$
   syntax, also like a separating conjunction, is sort of
   self-framing: $\M\mkpair \M'$ encompasses the universe of modules.
   Whereas the other way around, we'd need a (implicit) universe of
   all modules $\mathcal{U}$, and then define $\M' \triangleq
   \mathcal{U} - \M$  If we went with $\M'$ then Sophia couldn't use
   $\M''$ and friends --- have to write \texttt{N} and \texttt{O} for other
   modules?

   I think the only change I could see in the whole document was that
   lemma~\ref{lemma:module_pair_execution} is subsumed into
   lemma~\ref{lemma:linking:properties}.
 \end{quotation}
