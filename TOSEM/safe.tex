An earlier publication of this work, published at FASE 2020 \cite{FASE}, used an example of a Safe to
demonstrate how holistic specifications could be used to protect against dangerous implementations
of a safe. We now revisit this example, and discuss a bug that has since been discovered, along with
the nuance that this example points to in Chainmail. 

 \begin{figure}[htb]

   field treasure 
   field secret 
   method take(scr){
      if (secret==scr) then {
         t=treasure
         treasure = null
         return t }  }

  \caption{Two Versions of the class \prg{Safe}}
 \label{fig:ExampleSafe}
 \vspace*{-0.4cm}
 \end{figure}

Consider the two implementations of a \prg{Safe} class in Fig. \ref{fig:ExampleSafe}. Both implementations 
present a class with two fields:
\begin{itemize}
\item
\prg{treasure} : the object stored in the safe,  and 
\item
\prg{secret} : the password required to open the \prg{Safe} and remove the treasure.
\end{itemize}
Both implementations also include a method for using the 
 \prg{secret} to remove the \prg{treasure}: \prg{take}.
The second implementation also includes another method, \prg{set}, that allows any object to change the \prg{secret}.
This clearly violates any reasonable specification for a \prg{Safe}, and seems an ideal target for a Holistic specification.
 A classical Hoare triple describing the behaviour of \prg{take} would be:
 
  \vspace{.1in}
  
% \begin{figure}[htbp] 
(ClassicSpec)$  \ \ $  $\triangleq$
\vspace{-.1in}
\begin{lstlisting}
   method take(scr)
   PRE:   this:Safe  
   POST:  scr=this.secret$\pre$  $\longrightarrow$ this.treasure=null 
               $\wedge$
          scr$\neq$this.secret$\pre$ $\longrightarrow$  $\forall$s:Safe.$\,$s.treasure=s.treasure$\pre$
 \end{lstlisting}
%^\end{figure} 
\vspace{-.2in}

(ClassicSpec)  expresses  that knowledge of the \prg{secret} is  \emph{sufficient} %condition 
to remove the treasure, and further that  knowledge of the \prg{secret} is \emph{necessary} for
 \prg{take} to remove the \prg{treasure}. (ClassicSpec) does not however ensure that there
 is not some other means of removing the \prg{treasure}, or in the case of the second implementation
 of \prg{Safe}, changing the \prg{secret}. In order to capture such a specification, we would need 
 a holistic specification.
 
 
 
\vspace{.1in}
(HolisticSpec)\ \  $\triangleq$\\ 
$\strut \hspace{.3in}   \forall \prg{s}. % $\\ 
[\ \ \prg{s}:\prg{Safe} \wedge \prg{s.treasure}\neq\prg{null}   \wedge   \Future{\prg{s.treasure}=\prg{null}} $ \\ 
 $ \strut \hspace{4.3cm}     \longrightarrow \ \  \exists \prg{o}. [\  \External{\prg{o}} \wedge  \CanAccess{\prg{o}}{\prg{s.secret}}\ ]  \  \ ] \hfill $
\vspace{.1in}

(HolisticSpec) requires that for any \prg{Safe} with a non-null \prg{treasure}, if
that treasure is ever removed, it follows that there is some current external object 
with knowledge of the \prg{secret}. i.e. it is not possible to either forge, steal, 
or illegally modify the \prg{secret}. 

Both classes in Fig. \ref{fig:ExampleSafe} satisfy (ClassicSpec), and in the paper presented at FASE 2020 \cite{FASE}, 
we claimed that the first version satisfies (HolisticSpec) while the second does not. In fact neither implementation satisfies 
(HolisticSpec). The nuance is found in the notion of \prg{external} and \prg{internal}. The counter example to (HolisticSpec)
is where the \prg{secret} of one \prg{Safe}, say \prg{s1}, is stored as the \prg{treasure} of another, say \prg{s2}: i.e. \prg{s2.treasure = s1.secret}. 
In such a case, there might be no external objects with explicit knowledge of \prg{s1.secret} (since \prg{s2} is a \prg{Safe}, and thus considered \prg{internal}), but some object might 
know \prg{s2.secret}, and thus have a way to obtain \prg{s1.secret}, and finally removing \prg{s1.treasure}. 

The discovery of this bug identifies the nuances of \prg{external} and \prg{internal}. In the current formulation of 
Chainmail, these concepts are defined at a module level, but in the example of the Safe, are needed to be defined 
at a data-structure level. i.e. in our example above, we need to be able to say that \prg{s2} is external to \prg{s1}.
We have since reformulated the Safe example by making use of ghost fields to define what is internal and external 
to a \prg{Safe}.

 \begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{lstlisting}
class Safe{
   ghost is_internal(x) = x == this || x == secret
   field treasure 
   field secret 
   method take(scr){
      if (secret==scr) then {
         t=treasure
         treasure = null
         return t }  }
 }
\end{lstlisting}
  \vspace*{-0.95cm}
  \caption{A fixed version of the class \prg{Safe}}
 \label{fig:ExampleSafeFix}
 \end{figure}
 
 With the amended definition of \prg{Safe} in Fig. \ref{fig:ExampleSafeFix}, we are able to correctly express our original intent behind (HolisticSpec).
 Using the \prg{is\_internal} ghost field, we have defined what data is internal to the safe (rather than internal to the Module containing \prg{Safe}).
 
\vspace{.1in}
(HolisticSpecFixed)\ \  $\triangleq$\\ 
$\strut \hspace{.3in}   \forall \prg{s}. % $\\ 
[\ \ \prg{s}:\prg{Safe} \wedge \neg \prg{s.is\_internal(this)} \wedge \prg{s.treasure}\neq\prg{null}   \wedge   \Future{\prg{s.treasure}=\prg{null}} $ \\ 
 $ \strut \hspace{4.3cm}     \longrightarrow \ \  \exists \prg{o}. [\ \neg \prg{s.is\_internal(o)}  \wedge  \CanAccess{\prg{o}}{\prg{s.secret}}\ ]  \  \ ] \hfill $
\vspace{.1in}

 (HolisticSpecFixed) makes use of \prg{is\_internal} to say that for any \prg{Safe} \prg{s}, if \prg{s.treasure} is ever set to \prg{null}, then it follows that
 there is some current object \prg{o} that has access to \prg{s.secret} and is external to \prg{s} (and not the module containing \prg{Safe}). One final restriction that is required is that 
 the current object (\prg{this}) has not been inserted into the safe (as the secret itself!). This addition is required for a safe where construction of the 
 secret is not controlled by the safe. If construction (and thus setting of the secret) were controlled by the safe, such an addition would not be necessary.
