Here is stuff that we deleted, but might like to reuse.

The following came from beginning of foundations:
\kjx{\textbf{all these points should (already) be made by the example - the
  first one probably as early as the intro}
 As we already stated, this work is devoted to the specification of code in the open world. For these we propose what we call {\em holistic specifications.}
%
We claim that the most pertinent aspects of behaviour in the open world
are   in terms of  {\em necessary} conditions (\eg what can cause -- what are necessary conditions for --
 the balance of an account to decrease), rather than sufficient conditions (\eg the owner of an account may
 call the \prg{transfer} function, and as a result the balance decreases).
Such necessary conditions are not attached to particular function calls or program points; they apply
throughout program execution.
Therefore, they are expressed through  {\em invariants} that can be observed throughout the lifetime of a program, rather than at specific points in program execution.
