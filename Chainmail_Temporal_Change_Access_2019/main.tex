\title{Holistic Specifications for Robust Programs}


\begin{abstract}
Functional specifications of program components describe what
%components 
the code \emph{can} do --- the \emph{sufficient} conditions to
invoke the component's operations: 
 a client who supplies arguments
meeting that operation's preconditions can invoke it, % that \sd{behaviour}.
% \sophia{used to say  "invoke that operation" I think it is better to use one term.}
  and obtain the associated effect.
While specifications of sufficient conditions may be enough to reason about %the behaviour of
complete, unchanging  programs, they cannot support reasoning about
 components that interact with external components of possibly unknown provenance. 
In this  \emph{open world} setting, ensuring that your component is robust even when executing 
with buggy or malicious external code is critical.
 \emph{Holistic specifications}
--- as their name implies --- 
are concerned  with the \emph{overall} behaviour of a component,  in all possible 
interleavings of calls to the component's operations with those of the external code.
Thus, holistic specifications are concerned with \emph{sufficient} conditions, \ie
what is enough to \emph{cause} some effect, as well as with \emph{necessary} conditions, \ie
what are the conditions without which an effect will not happen. 
By adopting holistic specification techniques,
programmers can explicitly define what their components should not do,
making it easier to write
%  \sd{code}
% that support the construction of 
robust and reliable programs.

In this paper we argue for the need for such holistic specifications,
 propose a %specification 
 language \Chainmail for writing specifications, give a formal semantics, and discuss several
examples from the literature.

%conditions under which a behaviour can take place: constraining
%components' behaviours and defining what they \emph{cannot} do.  By
%adopting holistic specification techniques,
%programmers can explicitly define what their programs should not do\sophia{Weneed to argue that it is important to know
%what the program does not do}
%making it easier to write components
%that support the construction
%of robust and reliable programs.\sophia{We need to make the case that with necessary conditions we support robust and reliable}



%% We argue  that it is essential to specify policies which make a program robust,
%% and that the specification of what such robustness policies goes beyond  traditional function pre- and post-conditions.
%We propose new fundamental object-capability-inspired assertions
%which describe access and change, and combine these with space and time considersations
%(footprints temporal logic).
%Thus we obtain a logic which reflects not only over the current state, but
%also over the complete trace of an execution.

\section{Overview of the Formal foundations}
\label{sect:formal}
We now give an overview of the formal model for \Chainmail. In section \ref{sect:overviewmodel} we 
introduce  the shape of the judgments used to give semantics to \Chainmail, while in section \ref{sect:PL} 
we describe the most salient aspects of an underlying programming language used in \Chainmail.

literature where a holistic specification would provide obvious
benefits in ensuring robustness.

In two versions: one where there is a ledger inside the Mint, and one where the Mint has no path to the Purses. This will serve to demonstrate how \prg{internal} is supposed to work.

\subsection*{LATEX mysteries and terminology}
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item
 How can we make the references refer to the Definitions, Lemmas etc
 rather than the section where these appear?
 \begin{quotation}
   \color{orange} KJX:   Not sure what the problem is. I've put labels
   in the definitions and I can use refs to get definition
   numbers~\ref{defONE} and~\ref{def:syntax:classes} ---
   not ~\ref{secONE} and ~\ref{sec:syntax:classes}, the section
   numbers containing those definions.

   Alternatively there is the ``cleveref'' package
   \url{http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cleveref/cleveref.pdf}
   where a ``\verb+\cref{foo}+'' can generate both the type and the
   numbner e.g.  ``Definition 3''.
 \end{quotation}

 \item
 Need a nice metavariable for set of addresses, currently it is $R$. Perhaps instead use an enumeration, as eg $\{ \ \alpha_1,...\alpha_n\ \} $
 or $\kappa$?

 \begin{quotation}
 \color{orange} KJX: Hmm, the enumeration is fine. Otherwise $A$?
 $\mathcal{A}$?  Or we could call that set a ``footprint'' and so go
 with $F$ or $\mathcal{F}$\ldots
 \end{quotation}
\item
Find a nice term  to refer to module pairs  (internal, external), and a term for
our version visible states semantics.
 \begin{quotation}
   \color{orange} KJX: ``modules'' and ``modular state semantics''.
   Going to ``modules'' only makes sense with my answer below.
   Other permutations of
   ``visible module/modular state semantics'' work also work:
     modular visible state; visible modular state; etc\ldots
 \end{quotation}


\item
Better symbols for module linking (currently a $\M\link\M'$), and
for module pairing (currently a $\M\mkpair \M'$) -- perhaps there should not be such an operator, as
it does not create a new module, it is only used in execution ($\M\mkpair \M', \sigma \leadsto \sigma'$)
and in satisfaction of assertions ($\M\mkpair \M', \sigma\models \A$).
\footnote{\toby{TM: I like~$\M \mkpair \M'$ as it suggests the asymmetry of the visible
    state semantics wrt~$\M$ and~$\M'$.}}

 \begin{quotation}
   \color{orange} KJX: I'm so used to $\M\link\M'$ that I can't think
   of an alternative --- or do I recall we used $\M * \M'$ as a
   separating conjunction?

   So I really liked $\M\mkpair \M'$ --- except then I though that I
   couldn't remember which was the module (inside) and which the
   anti-module (the outside).  For some reason I thought outside would
   go first.  Then I realised, it's easy, cos $\M$ is always the
   module, and $\M'$ is the antimodule.

   At which point I though: OK so let's just write $\M$ as the module,
   and given any $\M$, then $\M'$ (or $\overline{\M}$ or I guess
   \textbf{out}($\M$)) for the antimodule.

   The only thing I think this loses is that the $\M\mkpair \M'$
   syntax, also like a seperating conjunction, is sort of
   self-framing: $\M\mkpair \M'$ encompasses the universe of modules.
   Whereas the other way around, we'd need a (implicit) universe of
   all modules $\mathcal{U}$, and then define $\M' \triangleq
   \mathcal{U} - \M$  If we went with $\M'$ then Sophia couldn't use
   $\M''$ and friends --- have to write \texttt{N} and \texttt{O} for other
   modules?

   I think the only change I could see in the whole document was that
   lemma~\ref{lemma:module_pair_execution} is subsumed into
   lemma~\ref{lemma:linking:properties}.
 \end{quotation}
