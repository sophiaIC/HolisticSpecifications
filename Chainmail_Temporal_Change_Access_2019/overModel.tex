%\section{Overview of the \Chainmail\  formal model}
% \subsection{The Open World}

Having outlined the ingredients of our holistic specification
language, the next question to ask is: When does a module $\M$ satisfy
a holistic assertion $\A$?  More formally: when does
$\M \models \A$ 
hold? 
  
Our answer has to reflect the fact that we are dealing with an rece
\emph{open  world},  where  $\M$, our module, may be
linked with \textit{arbitrary untrusted code}.
%
%
%% \sd{Note that we use the term \emph{module} to talk about repositories of code; in this work modules are mappings from
%% class identifiers to class definitions.}
%
%
To % skipped the discussion of what a module is
 model the open world, we consider
 pairs of modules, 
$\M \mkpair {\M'}$,  where $\M$ is the module 
whose code is supposed to satisfy the assertion,
and $\M'$  is  another % wused to say \textit{any}  -- but why?
 module which exercises
the functionality of $\M$. We call our module $\M$ the {\em internal} module, and
 $\M'$ the {\em external} module, which represents potential
 attackers or adversaries.
     
We can now answer the question: $\M \models \A$ 
 holds if for all further, {\em potentially adversarial}, modules $\M'$ and in  all runtime configurations $\sigma$ which may be observed as arising from the  execution of the code of $\M$ combined with that of $\M'$, the assertion $\A$ is satisfied. More formally, we define:\\
$~ \strut  \hspace{1.3in} \M \models \A \ \ \  \ \ \ \ \ \mbox{
if               } \ \ \  \ \ \  \  \forall \M'.\forall \sigma\in\Arising
{\M \mkpair  {\M'}}. [\ \M \mkpair  {\M'},\sigma \models \A\ ]$.  \\
Module $\M'$ represents all possible clients of {\M}.  As it is arbitrarily chosen, it reflects the open world nature of our specifications.% 

%% \sophia{Is is sentence superfluous now?.}
%% \sophia{In contrast to what we said on Friday's conf call we do not need to put any restrictions
%% on $\M'$ -- not even disjointness is required.}
%% \kjx{OK so in the \textbf{next iteration} we can just replace M;M' with a ' operator applied to any module\ldots}

The judgement $\M \mkpair  {\M'},\sigma \models \A$ means that  
assertion $\A$ is satisfied by  $\M \mkpair  {\M'}$ and $\sigma$.  
As in traditional specification languages \cite{Leavens-etal07,Meyer92}, satisfaction is judged 
in the context of a runtime configuration $\sigma$; but in addition, it is judged in the context of the internal and external modules.
%Satisfaction is also  judged in the context of modules; t
These are used to find   abstract functions defining ghost fields as well as  method bodies
needed when judging validity of temporal assertions such as
$\Future {\_}$.} %: the modules contain the code necessary to reach those configurations.

We distinguish between internal and external modules. This offers two advantages:
First, 
\Chainmail\ includes the ``$\External{\prg{o}}$'' assertion to require
that an object belongs to the external module, as in the Bank
Account's assertion (2) and (3) in
section~\ref{sect:motivate:Bank}. Second, we adopt a version of
visible states semantics \cite{MuellerPoetzsch-HeffterLeavens06,larch93,Meyer97}, treating all
executions within a module as atomic.
We only record runtime configurations which are {\em external}
 to module $\M$, \ie those where the
 executing object (\ie the current receiver) comes from module $\M'$.
 Execution % is  a judgment of 
 has the form\\
 $~ \strut  \hspace{1.3in}    \M \mkpair  {\M'},\sigma \leadsto \sigma'$\\  
% $\M \mkpair  {\M'},\sigma \leadsto \sigma'$\\  
where we ignore all intermediate steps
 with receivers  internal to $\M$. 
 % removed the below as it appears in next section.
%Similarly, when considering $\Arising {\M \mkpair  {\M'}}$, \ie the configurations arising from 
%executions in $\M \mkpair  {\M'}$, we can take method bodies defined in $\M$ or in $\M'$, but we will only consider the runtime 
%configurations which are external to $\M$.
%
In the next section we  shall 
outline the underlying programming language, and
define the judgment  $\M \mkpair  {\M'},\sigma \leadsto \sigma'$ and the set 
$\Arising {\M \mkpair  {\M'}}$.
