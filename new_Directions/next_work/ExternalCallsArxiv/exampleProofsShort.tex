Using our Hoare logic, we have developed a mechanised proof in Coq, that, indeed, $M_{good} \vdash S_2 \wedge S_3$.
This proof is \sdnew{part of the accompanying artifact.}
 
 Our proof models  \LangOO, the assertion language, the specification language, and the Hoare logic from \S \ref{s:hoare:first},  \S   \ref{s:hoare:second},  \S  \ref{sect:wf},  \S \aref{F}{\ref{app:hoare}} and Def. \ref{def:push}.
In keeping with   the start of  \S \ref{sect:proofSystem}, our proof assumes the existence of an underlying Hoare logic,  
and several, standard, properties of that underlying logic, the assertions logic (\eg equality of objects implies equality of field accesses) and of type systems
(\eg  fields of objects of different types cannot be aliases of one another).
All assumptions  are clearly indicated in the associated artifact.
 Appendix \aref{H}{\ref{s:app:example}}  %included in the auxiliary material, 
outlines   that proof. 

% Finally, we discuss why  $M_{good} \not\vdash S_2 $
