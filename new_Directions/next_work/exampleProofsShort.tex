Using our Hoare logic, we have developed a mechanised proof that, indeed, $M_{good} \vdash S_2 \wedge S_3$.
In our appendix \ref{s:app:example} we outline the main ingredients of that proof. 
We  expand our  semantics and logic to deal with scalars and conditionals, % and  rewrite the example in the syntax of \Loo.
and then highlight the most interesting proof steps of that proof.
The mechanised proof can be found at \red{XXX}.
% Finally, we discuss why  $M_{good} \not\vdash S_2 $
