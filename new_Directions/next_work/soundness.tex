In this section we demonstrate that the proof system presented in section \ref{sect:proofSystem} is sound. 
For this, we give a stronger, deeper meaning to our Hoare tuples  (Sect \ref{s:deep:valid}), which requires that \se{satisfaction} of assertions is preserved from the perspective of several frames, rather than just the top frame.

% In Sect.  \ref{s:deep:mean} we define deep satisfaction of assertions. 
% In Sect \ref{sect:HLmeans} we define deep satisfaction of specifications.
% We give the usual meaning to the Hoare triples (Sect \ref{sect:HLmeans}), in a deep as well as shallow version,
We prove soundness of of Hoare triples (Sect \ref{sect:prove:triples:sound}).
We then show how execution starting from some external state can be summarised into purely external execution and terminating execution of public methods (Sect \ref{sect:termExecs}). We then use these decompositions and a well-founded ordering to prove soundness of our quadruples  and of the overall system (Sect \ref{sect:prove:sound:quadruples}).


\subsection{Deep Satisfaction} 
\label{s:deep:valid}
% SOME MOVED

As we saw in section \ref{s:viewAndProtect}, it is possible  for an assertion to hold in some state,  but no longer hold after popping the top frame from the stack. 
This has implications for the appropriate meaning of Hoare tuples:

\begin{example}
\label{ex:motivate:deep}
Assume state $\sigma_a$, such that $\interpret {\sigma_a} {\prg{this}}=o_1$, $\interpret {\sigma} {\prg{this}.f}=o_2$, $\interpret {\sigma} {x}=o_3$, $\interpret {\sigma} {x.f}=o_2$,  
and $\interpret {\sigma} {x.g}=o_4$, where $o_2$ is external and all other objects are internal. 
We then have $..,\sigma_a \models  \inside {o_4}$.
Assume that the continuation of $\sigma_a$   consists of a method $x.m()$. Then,
upon entry to that method, when we push the new frame, we have a state $\sigma_b$, which also satisfies $..,\sigma_a \models  \inside {o_4}$.
Assume that the   body of $m$ is $\prg{this}.f.m1(\prg{this}.g); \prg{this}.f := \prg{this};  \prg{this}.g := \prg{this}$, and that the external method $m1$ stores in the 
receiver a reference to the argument.
Then, at the end of method execution, and before popping the stack, we have a state $\sigma_c$, which also satisfies $..,\sigma_c \models  \inside {o_4}$.
However, after we pop the stack, we obtain $\sigma_d$, for which $..,\sigma_d \not\models  \inside {o_4}$.
\end{example}
 

To address this problem, we introduce ``deep satisfaction'' of assertions $ \satDAssertFrom M  \sigma k   A$ which says that $A$ is satisfied in $\sigma$  in all frames of $\sigma$ from $k$ onwards, 
\ie  $ \satDAssertFrom M  \sigma k   A$ iff $\sigma = ((\phi_1\cdot ... \phi_n), \chi)$ and $k\leq n$ and $\forall j. [\  k\leq j \leq n \ \Rightarrow \ M, ((\phi_1\cdot ... \phi_j), \chi) \models A'\ ]$ where $A'$ is $A$ where all free variables have been substituted according to $\phi_n$ -- \cf Def. \ref{def:restrict}.
We then introduce ``deep'' quadruples,   $\satisfiesD {M} {\quadruple  {A} }   {\sigma}   {A'} {A''}$ , which promise that if $\sigma$ satisfies $A$ from $k$ onwards, then, and executes its continuation to termination, then the final state will satisfy $A'$ from $k$ onwards, and also, all intermediate external states will satisfy $A''$ from $k$ onwards - \cf Def \ref{def:restrict}.
We define   $\satisfiesD {M} {\quadruple  {A} }   {stmt}   {A'} {A''} $ and  $\satisfiesD {M} {S}$ accordingly.


Thus. continuing with example \ref{ex:motivate:deep},  we have that\ \  $\satisfies {M} {\quadruple   {\inside {o_4}} }   {\sigma_b}   {\inside {o_4}}  {true} $, \ \ 
 but \\ $\notSatisfiesD {M}   {\quadruple   {\inside {o_4}} }  {\sigma_b}   {\inside {o_4}}  {true}  $.
\ \  In general, deep satisfaction is stronger than shallow:   
 
\begin{lemma}[Deep   vs Shallow Satisfaction]
For all $M$, $A$, $A'$, $A''$, $\sigma$, $stmt$, and $S$
\begin{itemize}
\item
 $\satisfiesD {M} {\quadruple  {A} }   {\sigma}   {A'} {A''}   \ \ \ \Longrightarrow \ \ \   \satisfies {M} {\quadruple  {A} }   {\sigma}   {A'} {A''}$

\item
 $\satisfiesD {M} {\quadruple  {A} }   {stmt}   {A'} {A''}   \ \ \ \Longrightarrow \ \ \   \satisfies {M} {\quadruple  {A} }   {stmt}   {A'} {A''}$
\item 
$\satisfiesD {M} {S}  \ \ \ \Longrightarrow \ \ \ \satisfies {M} {S}$
\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

\subsection{Soundness of the Hoare Triples Logic}

We require  that the supporting proof system for assertions, $M\vdash A$, and the  underlying Hoare logic, $M\ \vdash_{ul}\  \triple A {stmt} {A'}$, are sound:
\begin{axiom}
\label{lemma:axiom:enc:assert:ul}
\label{ax:ul:sound}
We require for all $M$, $A$, $A'$, $stmt$:
\begin{center}
$M \vdash A   \ \ \ \  \Longrightarrow  \ \ \ \  \forall \sigma.[\ M, \sigma \models A\ ]$.\\
% \end{center}
%\end{axiom}
%
%\noindent
%Moreover, we assume that the  \ie for all $A$, $A'$, $stmt$:\ \ \  
%
%\begin{axiom}
% \begin{center}
{$M\ \vdash_{ul}\  \triple A {stmt} {A'}  \ \ \ \  \Longrightarrow  \ \ \ \ \satisfies  {M} { \triple A {stmt} {A'}}$ }
 \end{center}
\end{axiom}

\noindent
\label{sect:prove:triples:sound}
We prove various properties about protection
\cf section \ref{s:app:protect:lemmas}.
Using these lemmas. we prove soundness of the inference system for triples $M \vdash  \triple A {stmt} {A'} $ -- \cf \A, \ref{s:sound:app:triples}.

 
 


\begin{Theorem}
\label{l:triples:sound}
For module  $M$ % and $\Mtwo$, 
such that  $\vdash M$, and for any assertions $A$,  $A'$, $A''$ and statement  $stmt$:
\begin{center}
$M\ \vdash\  \triple A {stmt} {A'}  \ \ \ \  \Longrightarrow  \ \ \ \ \satisfiesD {M} {\quadruple {A} {stmt} {A'} {A''}}$
\end{center}
\end{Theorem}
 



\subsection{Soundness of the Hoare Quadruples, and of the overall System}

For the soundness proof of our quadruples we need to address two challenges:
First, that we need to apply induction on the execution, as well as on the Hoare logic proof. 
Second, that execution of an external call may consist os any number of external steps, interleaved with calls of public, internal methods, which in their turn may may make external calls, leading to further calls of public methods.


We address the first challenge  through the definition of a well-founded ordering (\cf Section \ref{sect:prove:wellfounded}). 
We address the second challenge by introducing summarised executions, which essentially collapse all public, internal method calls into one large step (\cf Section \ref{sect:termExecs}).

\subsubsection{A well-founded ordering}
\label{sect:prove:wellfounded}

We define that $(A_1,\sigma_1,A_2, A_3) \ll_{M,\Mtwo}  (A_4,\sigma_2,A_5, A_6)$ if $\sigma_1$ executes to terminations in fewer steps than $\sigma_2$ considering the shortest, terminating scoped execution), or  the proof of $M \vdash \quadruple {A_1} {\sigma.\prg{cont}} {A_2} {A_3} $
is shallower than the the proof of  $M \vdash \quadruple {A_4} {\sigma.\prg{cont}} {A_5} {A_6} $ (considering the shallowest possible proofs). Full Def. in \ref{def:measure}.

 

 


\begin{auxLemma}
\label{lemma:normal:two}
For any modules $M$ and $\Mtwo$,  the relation $\_ \ll_{M,\Mtwo}  \_$ is well-founded.
\end{auxLemma}

\subsubsection{Summarised  execution} 
\label{sect:termExecs}

In this subsection we prove auxiliary lemmas that allow us to summarise execution into  constituent parts, which are useful for the proof of soundness of our quadruples, Theorem \ref{t:quadruple:sound}, when we consider sequences of statements, and also method calls.

%We prove some unsurprising 
% DO we need it?
%Lemma \ref{lemma:encl:tem} guarantees that any state reachable from a state with a terminating execution has itself a terminating execution, and that this execution is enclosed in the original one:
% Lemma \ref{lemma:subexp} makes the usual guarantee about terminating execution of statement sequences.
 


\label{sect:termExecs}

The challenge in the proof of soundness of our quadruples, Theorem \ref{t:quadruple:sound} is the proof of external calls. 
Namely, an external call may eventually call any number of public, internal, methods, which , in turn, may make further external calls.
Thus, an external call will involve several internal and external states.

\vspace{.1cm}

\begin{tabular}{lll}
\begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}
The diagram to the left shows such an execution, where
  $ \leadstoBoundedStarFin {\Mtwo\cdot M}    {\sigma_2}  {\sigma_{30}}$ consists of 4 calls to external objects,
and 3 calls to internal objects.
The calls to external objects are from $\sigma_2$ to $\sigma_3$,  from $\sigma_3$ to $\sigma_4$, from $\sigma_9$ to $\sigma_{10}$, 
and  from $\sigma_{16}$ to $\sigma_{17}$.
 The calls to internal objects are from $\sigma_5$ to $\sigma_6$, rom $\sigma_7$ to $\sigma_8$, and from $\sigma_{21}$ to $\sigma_{23}$. 
\end{minipage}
& \ \  &
\begin{minipage}{.4\textwidth}
\resizebox{6.2cm}{!}
{
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{diagrams/summaryA.png}
} \end{minipage}
\end{tabular}
 
\vspace{.1cm}

When proving soundness of the rule {\sc{Call\_Ext}}, % and  {\sc{Call\_Ext\_Adapt}}
we will use that  $M \vdash \encaps A$ (and also deep satisfaction)  to argue that 
external transitions (from one external call to another) will preserve $A$. 
For the internal calls, we want to just apply the fact that the method body has been proven to preserve $A$ (by  {\sc{MEthod}}).
That is, for the external states we consider small steps, while for each of the public method calls we consider large steps. 
Moreover, for the external states we apply different arguments than for the internal states.

\vspace{.1cm}

\begin{tabular}{lll}
\begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}
 In terms of our example, we want to summarise the execution of the two "outer" internal, public methods into the 
 "large" steps $\sigma_6$ to $\sigma_{19}$ and $\sigma_{23}$ to $\sigma_{24}$.
 And are not concerned with the states reached from these two public method executions.  
\end{minipage}
& \ \  &
\begin{minipage}{.4\textwidth}
\resizebox{6.2cm}{!}
{
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{diagrams/summaryB.png}
} \end{minipage}
\end{tabular} 

 \vspace{.1cm}
 
In order to express such summaries, Def. \ref{def:exec:sum} introduces the following concepts:
\begin{itemize}
\item
 ${\leadstoBoundedThreeStarExt {\Mtwo\cdot M} {\sigma\bd}  {\sigma}  {\sigma'}}$ \ \ \  a scoped execution from $\sigma$ to $\sigma'$ scoped by $\sigma\bd$.
\item
${\WithPub {\Mtwo\cdot M}    {\sigma}  {\sigma'} {\sigma_1}}$ \  \ \  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  ${\sigma}$ is an external state  calling an internal public method, $\sigma'$ is the state after return from the public method, and $\sigma_1$ is the first state upon entry to the public method.  
%$\WithExtPub {\Mtwo\cdot M} {\sigma\bd}  {\sigma}  {\sigma'} {\epsilon}$ \ \     \ \  $\triangleq$ \ \ 
%$\leadstoBoundedThreeStarExt {\Mtwo\cdot M} {\sigma\bd}  {\sigma}  {\sigma''}$
%\item
%$\WithExtPub {\Mtwo\cdot M} {\sigma\bd}  {\sigma}  {\sigma'} {\sigma_1...\sigma_n}$   \ \  int
%\item
%$\leadstoBoundedExtPub {\Mtwo\cdot M}    {\sigma}  {\sigma'} $   \ \ \ \ \   \ \ \  \ \ \ \   \ \ \ \  $\triangleq$   \ \ 
%  $ \exists n\in \mathbb{N}. \exists \sigma_1,...\sigma_n. \ \WithExtPub {\Mtwo\cdot M} {\sigma}  {\sigma}  {\sigma'} {\sigma_1...\sigma_n} 
%$
\end{itemize}
  
Continuing with our example, we have the following execution summaries:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
${\leadstoBoundedThreeStarExt {\Mtwo\cdot M} {\sigma_3}  {\sigma_3}  {\sigma_5}}$\ \ \ 
Namely,  execution from $\sigma_3$ to $\sigma_5$ is scoped by $\sigma_3$, and  only involves external states.  
\item
${\WithPub {\Mtwo\cdot M}    {\sigma_5}  {\sigma_{20}} {\sigma_{6}}}$. \ \ \ 
Namely, the public method call from the external state $\sigma_5$ into the internal state $\sigma_6$ leads to $\sigma_{20}$. 
Note that execution summarises two  internal method executions ($\sigma_{6}-\sigma_{19}$, and $\sigma_8-\sigma_{14}$),
and two internal method executions ($\sigma_{6}-\sigma_{19}$, and $\sigma_8-\sigma_{14}$).
\item
 ${\leadstoBoundedThreeStarExt {\Mtwo\cdot M} {\sigma_3}  {\sigma_{20}}  {\sigma_{21}}}$.
 \item
${\WithPub {\Mtwo\cdot M}    {\sigma_{21}}  {\sigma_{25}} {\sigma_{23}}}$. \ \ \ 
A  public method call from an external state ${\sigma_{21}}$ into internal state $\sigma_{23}$, and returning to external state $\sigma_25$
 \item
  ${\leadstoBoundedThreeStarExt {\Mtwo\cdot M} {\sigma_3}  {\sigma_{25}}  {\sigma_{28}}}$.
\ \ \ 
  Purely external execution, scoped by ${\sigma_3}$
\end{enumerate}

Lemma \ref{lemma:external_breakdown} says that a terminating execution,  $ \leadstoBoundedStarFin {\Mtwo}  {\sigma}  {\sigma'}$ starting in an external state  consists of a sequence of  external states interleaved with terminating executions in internal states. 
It %of Auxialiry lemma \ref{lemma:external_breakdown} 
is illustrated through an example in Fig. \ref{fig:summaries}.
We first define some further notations for execution:







%
% \begin{figure}[htb]
%\begin{tabular}{lc|cl}
%\strut \hspace{1.4cm}  original execution:
%& & &
%\strut \hspace{1.4cm}  summarised execution:
% \\

%} 
%\end{tabular}
%   \caption{Summaries. 
%   }
%   \label{fig:summaries}
% \end{figure}
 

For illustration of our lemma \ref{lemma:external_breakdown:term}, we consider, again,  Fig. \ref{fig:summaries}: 

 
 \begin{auxLemma}
\label{lemma:external_breakdown:term}[Summarised Executions]
For   module $M$, modules $\Mtwo$, and states $\sigma$, $\sigma'$:
\\
\begin{itemize}
\item
$M,\sigma \models \extThis\ \wedge \ \leadstoBoundedStarFin {M\cdot \Mtwo}  {\sigma}  {\sigma'}  \ \ \  \ 
\Longrightarrow \ \ \  \ \leadstoBoundedExtPub {\Mtwo\cdot M}    {\sigma}  {\sigma'}$
\item
$M,\sigma \models \extThis\ \wedge \ \leadstoBoundedStar  {M\cdot \Mtwo}  {\sigma}  {\sigma'}  \ \ \  \ \ \  
\Longrightarrow$\\
$\strut \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \    \leadstoBoundedExtPub {\Mtwo\cdot M}    {\sigma}  {\sigma'}\ \ \ \  \vee$\\
$\strut \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \    \exists \sigma_1,\sigma_2.[\

\wedge \ M, \sigma_2 \models \pubMeth \wedge \leadstoBoundedStar  {\Mtwo\cdot M}    {\sigma_2}  {\sigma'} \ ]
$
\end{itemize}
\end{auxLemma}
 


The lemma  \ref{lemma:external_exec_preserves_more} describes how an encapsulated assertion $A$ is preserved during an execution, 
provided that all finalising internal executions preserved it. 
It will be used in the proof of soundness of the rule {\sc{ExtCall\_WithSpec\_Weak}}\footnoteSD{perhaps also {\sc{ExtCall\_WithSpec\_Strong}}}



\begin{auxLemma}
\label{lemma:external_exec_preserves_more}[Preservation of Encapsulated Assertions]
For any module $M$, modules $\Mtwo$, variables $\overline x$, and addresses $\overline \alpha$,
 states $\sigma\bd$, $\sigma$, and $\sigma'$, and assertions $A$, $A'$,

\begin{enumerate}

\item

 $\Longrightarrow $
\\
$M, \sigma' \models A' $

\Longrightarrow \  M, \sigma_f \models A' \ ]$\\
$\Longrightarrow $
\\
$M, \sigma' \models A' $
\end{enumerate}

TOTHINK: Do we also need that $A$ is a module invariant?
\end{auxLemma}

\subsection{ Soundness of Hoare Quadruples Logic, and the overall system}
