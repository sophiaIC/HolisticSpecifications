\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}

\paragraph{External calls}

In today's complex software, internal, trusted, code  is tightly intertwined  with external, untrusted, code: external code
calls into internal code, internal code calls
out to external code  and external code  even calls back  into internal code --- all within the same call chain.


This paper addresses reasoning about \emph{external calls} --- when
trusted internal code calls out to untrusted, unknown external code.
This reasoning is hard because by ``external code'' we mean untrusted
code where we don't have a specification.
External code may even have been written by an attacker trying to subvert or destroy the whole system.  
%Worse still, external code can call back into internal code as part of the same call chain. SUSAN:said in the paragraph before.
\forget{
External code may be written years or decades after the core 
trusted system was released --- software plugins for audio and video
editors have lasted for more than thirty years, and new
trusted retrocomputing hosts (``emulators'')
can run code for machines back to the Manchester 
Baby \cite{MAME-SSEM}, where source code is long lost in the bits of
history \cite{Smalltalk-bits}.

What  if  \prg{untrst}   calls back into $M_{intl}$? %, \eg  by calling  \prg{m1}? -- chpped as obvious how. and shorter.

 \paragraph{External calls  need not have  arbitrary   effects} 
If the programming language supports encapsulation (\eg no address forging, private
 fields, %, ownership, no direct memory access 
 \etc) then internal modules can be  written \emph{defensively} %\cite{MillerPhD}, 
so  that effects are

 \begin{customquote}
\emph{Precluded}, \ie  guaranteed to \emph{never happen}.
  E.g., a  correct  %defensive 
 implementation of the DAO  \cite{Dao} can ensure that  
 the DAO's balance  never falls below the sum of the balances of its subsidiary accounts.

% or

 \emph{Limited}, \ie  they  \emph{may happen}, but %are guaranteed to happen
  \emph{only if} the external 
code  uses  certain \emph{object  capabilities}.
E.g., while the DAO does not preclude that a signatory's balance will decrease, it  does ensure that the balance decreases only if the
code causing this reduction used  the signatory itself.
 
 \end{customquote}
 
 \vspace{.1cm}
 
\noindent
Reasoning about precluded effects %guaranteed to never happen 
has been studied in the context of object invariants   \cite{staticsfull,DrossoFrancaMuellerSummers08,BarDelFahLeiSch04,objInvars,MuellerPoetzsch-HeffterLeavens06}. 
Reasoning about effects limited  through capabilities is the remit of this paper.
  
%  While the literature has explored external calls \cite{vanproving,cerise-jacm2024,vmsl-pldi2023,ddd}, ``robust safety'' \cite{gordonJefferyRobustSafety,robustSafetyPatrignani,abate2019journey}, \etc, to our knowledge, there is no widely accepted term limiting the range of effects resulting from external calls.
 


 
 
\paragraph{The Object Capabiltiy Model} \red{James to improve this paragraph}
Object Capability Model (OCAP)  \cite{MillerPhD}  is a security model   based on the concept of capabilities, which  
Capabilities are transferable rights that allow the performance of one or more operations on a specific object. 
Capabilities are unforgeable and can be obtained only through creation of the corresponding object, or through receipt of a message.
Capabilities are {\emph{necessary}} conditions for causing effects; callers can only produce effects if they possess the required capabilities. 
For example, a signatory can withdraw funds from a DAO only if they hold a ``withdraw'' capability for that specific account within that particular DAO.  

Languages like E, subsets of JavaScript (CITE SES), Caja, Wyvern, Rholang,  implement OCAP principles. CITE-CITE-CITE


\paragraph{Reasoning with Capabilties}
%In this paper we demonstrate how to reason about  code which \tames effects,
%{including those \tamed by capabilities.}  
%We can specify effects to be \tamed, 
%and then we can \emph{prove} that a module has indeed \tamed the effects we've specified.
%
 Recent work has developed logics to prove properties of programs employing object capabilities.
\citet{ddd} develop a logic to prove that code employing object
capabilities for encapsulation preserves invariants for
intertwined code, but without external calls. 
\forget{Relying on techniques from separation logic, they intend their proofs e.g.\ to support library components that can be reused in different contexts.}
\forget{--- which is implicitly support in our distinction between external and internal code.
 \footnote{\red{TO CHECK}\kjx{I have looked at it - good enough for
 me.}}}
  \citet{dd} \forget{work with Kripke logical relations describing program semantics, which} can describe and verify invariants
about multi-object structures and the availability and exercise of object capabilities.  %\citeauthor{dd} 
% They propose and solve several
% problems involving external calls. 
\forget{,  but require proofs specific to each individual problem, rather than a systematic Hoare logic.}
 Similarly,
{\citet{vmsl-pldi2023} propose a separation logic to support formal modular reasoning about communicating VMs, including in the presence of unknown VMs.
\citet{irisWasm23} specify WASM modules, %and compose them in a simple target language, 
and prove that adversarial code  can only affect other modules through the functions} that they explicitly export. 
%Since external calls may in turn call any number of internal, public methods, 
%it is crucial  to prove that \taming of effects is preserved by the module's 
%\emph{emergent} behaviour, \ie any intertwining of external code with calls to internal, public methods.
\citet{CassezFQ24}  handle external calls by replacing them through an unbounded number of calls to the module's public methods.
 
 The approaches above %, with partical exception of  \cite{{FASE,OOPSLA22} 
 do not aim to support indirect, eventual access to capabilities.
\citet{FASE} and \citet{OOPSLA22} do describe such access; %concentrate on access to capabilities;
  the former proposes  ``holistic specifications'' to describe a module's emergent behaviour. 
and the latter develops 
a tailor-made logic to prove that modules which do not contain external calls adhere to such specifications.
%They propose a tailor-made proof for an external call.
%We argue that in order to \emph{prove} that effects are \tamed,
%we need a way to specify the conditions necessary for that effect, 
%and a way to prove that the   module in its entirety preserves this \taming.
%In order to prove that the module in its entirety preserves this \taming, 
% \vspace{.2cm} 
% Thus, no work so far has tackled Hoare logics which support external calls as well as \tamed effects.
%
%\vspace{.03cm}
%
%Other than this, 
%{To} reason about the effects of specific external calls,
%the systems above {would} rely on problem-specific, custom-made proofs rather than a Hoare logic.
Rather than relying on problem-specific, custom-made proofs, we propose a Hoare logic that addresses access to capabilities, limited effects, and external calls.
% and their limited effects.

  
\paragraph{This paper's contributions} % In this paper we propose 
{(1) assertions to describe   access to capabilities}, 
(2) a specification language to effects limited through capabilties.
3) a Hoare logic to reason about external calls and to prove that modules satisfy their %\tamed effects 
specifications,
4)  proof of soundness,
5) a worked illustrative example {with a mechanised proof in Coq}.
