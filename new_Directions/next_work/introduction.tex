\section{Introduction: Necessary Conditions and Robustness}
\label{s:intro}

reason in the open world is not only about preservation of simple invariants; it is about reasoning about possible effects. These are reduced/increased through the availability of capabilities.

The "others" tackle the problem of the ambient authority in a 1-step manner, eg there is a module, and if it exports a capability this capability may be used. For example, xxxx 

FASE/OOPSLA support unrestricted ambient authority, but not the reasoning part. For example, xxxx

In this paper, we support unrestricted ambient authority, and also reasoning. We are inspired by the work in FASE/OOSPLA, but with the following differences

1) replace the temporal operators of FASE/necessity operators of oopsla by 2-state spec-s 

2) when reasoning about a module's adherence to a 2-state spec, replace the xxx rules from OOPSLA by just one rule -- inspired by Infeasibility logic

3) add one Hoare logic rule to reason about calls to external call; and add Hoare logic rules that reason about the accessibility of objects from other objects
