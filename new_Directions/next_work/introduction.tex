\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}

\paragraph{External calls}

In today's complex software, internal, trusted, code  is tightly intertwined  with external, untrusted, code: external code
calls into internal code, internal code calls
out to external code  and external code  even calls back  into internal code --- all within the same call chain.


This paper addresses reasoning about \emph{external calls} --- when
trusted internal code calls out to untrusted, unknown external code.
This reasoning is hard because by ``external code'' we mean untrusted
code where we don't have a specification.
External code may even have been written by an attacker trying to subvert or destroy the whole system.  
%Worse still, external code can call back into internal code as part of the same call chain. SUSAN:said in the paragraph before.
\forget{
External code may be written years or decades after the core 
trusted system was released --- software plugins for audio and video
editors have lasted for more than thirty years, and new
trusted retrocomputing hosts (``emulators'')
can run code for machines back to the Manchester 
Baby \cite{MAME-SSEM}, where source code is long lost in the bits of
history \cite{Smalltalk-bits}.

 \paragraph{External calls  need not have  arbitrary   effects} 
If the programming language supports encapsulation (\eg no address forging, private
 fields, %, ownership, no direct memory access 
 \etc) then internal modules can be  written \emph{defensively} %\cite{MillerPhD}, 
so  that effects are

 \begin{customquote}
\emph{Precluded}, \ie  guaranteed to \emph{never happen}.
  E.g., a  correct  %defensive 
 implementation of the DAO  \cite{Dao} can ensure that  
 the DAO's balance  never falls below the sum of the balances of its subsidiary accounts.


 \emph{Limited}, \ie  they  \emph{may happen}, but  
  \emph{only if} the external 
code  uses  certain \emph{object  capabilities}.
E.g., while the DAO does not preclude that a signatory's balance will decrease, it  does ensure that the balance decreases only if the
code causing this reduction used  the signatory itself.

%\sdred{Reasoning about  effects limited through capabilities is the remit of this paper.}
Precluded effects \sdred{is a special}  case of effects limited through capabilities -- reasoning about these 
has been studied in the context of object invariants   \cite{staticsfull,DrossoFrancaMuellerSummers08,BarDelFahLeiSch04,objInvars,MuellerPoetzsch-HeffterLeavens06}. 
{Reasoning about effects limited  through capabilities is the remit of this paper.}
  
%  While the literature has explored external calls \cite{vanproving,cerise-jacm2024,vmsl-pldi2023,ddd}, ``robust safety'' \cite{gordonJefferyRobustSafety,robustSafetyPatrignani,abate2019journey}, \etc, to our knowledge, there is no widely accepted term limiting the range of effects resulting from external calls.
 


 
 
\paragraph{The Object Capability Model}\footnoteSD{SD says: check whether these two paragraph caliry the "necessary" nature}


The object-capability model combines the ``capabilities'' developed
for operating system security 
\forget{as in the Cambridge CAP or IBM
System/38} 
(\cite{levy:capabilities,CAP}) with pure object-oriented
programming
\forget{as SELF or Actors}(\cite{selfpower,selfexp95,agha_actors_1987}).  Capability-based
operating systems reify effects and resources 
\forget{(such as memory regions,
files, or even hardware devices)}as \textit{capabilities} ---
unforgeable, distinct, duplicable, attenuable, communicable bitstrings
which both denote a resource and grant rights which can be exercised
over that resource. Access control\forget{over effects} is\forget{then} achieved
solely by controlling access to the capabilities.\forget{that reify those
effects. To create a new file, for example, a process must possess a
capability to the directory that will contain the new file, a
capability strong enough to create new files. Invoking the
``\texttt{creat}'' system call \cite{Kern84a} on that capability will
create a new file and return a capability for that file.  Duplicating
the capability and sending it to another process shares the file with
that process, granting that process access to the file; sending a suitably
attenuated capability can e.g.\ grant the other process read-only
access.}


% \forget{As described by} 
Mark Miller's \cite{MillerPhD}
\textit{object}-capability model uses\forget{on the recognition that}
object references\forget{satisfy all the requirements to be effective}
as capabilities. 
Building on early object-capability languages such as E
\cite{MillerPhD,ELang} and Joe-E \cite{JoeE}, 
a range of recent programming languages and web systems
\cite{CapJavaHayesAPLAS17,CapNetSocc17Eide,DOCaT14} including Newspeak
\cite{newspeak17},
AmbientTalk \cite{ambientTalk}
Dart \cite{dart15}, Grace \cite{grace,graceClasses},
JavaScript (aka Secure EcmaScript \cite{miller-esop2013}),
and Wyvern \cite{wyverncapabilities} have adopted the object
capability model.
%\forget{Object references cannot be forged; each refers to a distinct object; references can be duplicated (by reference
%assignment, SIMULA's ``\texttt{:-}''); attenuated (typically via Proxies \cite{gof,proxiesECOOP2013}); and communicated to other
%objects. Possession of a ``reference to an object'' (in this setting, also described as possessing an ``object-capability'', a
%``capability'', a ``reference'') can be used to execute any method in that object's public interface. Critically, in object-capability systems
%there is no third-party access controller or security manager or hypervisor which is responsible for security --- rather} 
Security  and encapsulation 
is encoded in the relationships between the objects, and the interactions between them.
%\forget{-- interactions which can communicate capabilities around the system.  As such, object
%capabilities offer a seamless model throughout a programming language or even a distributed global system\footnote{To quote Dan Ingalls,
%``Operating System:\ldots there shouldn't be one'' \cite{ingalls1981}.}. } 
 As argued in  \cite{capeFTfJP}, %Drossopoulou and Noble have put it:
%\textit{``
object capabilities are a mechanism which makes it possible to write secure
  programs
  '% }  %  \cite{capeFTfJP}\forget{ in ways other security models simply do not, }although they 
  but cannot guarantee that any particular program
  \sdred{using the provided mechanism is, indeed,  secure.}
  %  uses the provided mechanism to be correct or even secure.

%% Capabilities are transferable rights that allow the performance of one or more operations on a specific object. 
%% Capabilities are unforgeable and can be obtained only through creation of the corresponding object, or through receipt of a message.

\paragraph{Reasoning with Capabilities}
%In this paper we demonstrate how to reason about  code which \tames effects,
%{including those \tamed by capabilities.}  
%We can specify effects to be \tamed, 
%and then we can \emph{prove} that a module has indeed \tamed the effects we've specified.
%
 Recent work has developed logics to prove properties of programs employing object capabilities.
\citet{ddd} develop a logic to prove that code employing object
capabilities for encapsulation preserves invariants for
intertwined code, but without external calls. 
\forget{Relying on techniques from separation logic, they intend their proofs e.g.\ to support library components that can be reused in different contexts.}
\forget{--- which is implicitly support in our distinction between external and internal code.
 \footnote{\red{TO CHECK}\kjx{I have looked at it - good enough for
 me.}}}
  \citet{dd} \forget{work with Kripke logical relations describing program semantics, which} can describe and verify invariants
about multi-object structures and the availability and exercise of object capabilities.  %\citeauthor{dd} 
% They propose and solve several
% problems involving external calls. 
\forget{,  but require proofs specific to each individual problem, rather than a systematic Hoare logic.}
 Similarly,
{\citet{vmsl-pldi2023} propose a separation logic to support formal modular reasoning about communicating VMs, including in the presence of unknown VMs.
\citet{irisWasm23} specify WASM modules, %and compose them in a simple target language, 
and prove that adversarial code  can only affect other modules through the functions} that they explicitly export. 
%Since external calls may in turn call any number of internal, public methods, 
%it is crucial  to prove that \taming of effects is preserved by the module's 
%\emph{emergent} behaviour, \ie any intertwining of external code with calls to internal, public methods.
\citet{CassezFQ24}  handle external calls by replacing them through an unbounded number of calls to the module's public methods.
 
 The approaches above %, with partical exception of  \cite{{FASE,OOPSLA22} 
 do not aim to support indirect, eventual access to capabilities.
\citet{FASE} and \citet{OOPSLA22} do describe such access; %concentrate on access to capabilities;
  the former proposes  ``holistic specifications'' to describe a module's emergent behaviour. 
and the latter develops 
a tailor-made logic to prove that modules which do not contain external calls adhere to such specifications.
%They propose a tailor-made proof for an external call.
%We argue that in order to \emph{prove} that effects are \tamed,
%we need a way to specify the conditions necessary for that effect, 
%and a way to prove that the   module in its entirety preserves this \taming.
%In order to prove that the module in its entirety preserves this \taming, 
% \vspace{.2cm} 
% Thus, no work so far has tackled Hoare logics which support external calls as well as \tamed effects.
%
%\vspace{.03cm}
%
%Other than this, 
%{To} reason about the effects of specific external calls,
%the systems above {would} rely on problem-specific, custom-made proofs rather than a Hoare logic.
Rather than relying on problem-specific, custom-made proofs, we propose a Hoare logic that addresses access to capabilities, limited effects, and external calls.
% and their limited effects.

  
\paragraph{This paper's contributions} % In this paper we propose 
{(1) assertions to describe   access to capabilities}, 
(2) a specification language to effects limited through capabilities.
3) a Hoare logic to reason about external calls and to prove that modules satisfy their %\tamed effects 
specifications,
4)  proof of soundness,
5) a worked illustrative example {with a mechanised proof in Coq}.
