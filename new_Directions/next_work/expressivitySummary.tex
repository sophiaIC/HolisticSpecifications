 \paragraphSD{Expressiveness} 
%\subsection{Expressiveness} 
In  \S \ref{app:expressivity} we argue the expresseness of our approach  through a sequence of capability patterns studied in related approaches from the literature  
 \cite{OOPSLA22,dd,VerX,irisWasm23,ddd} and written in our specification language.
These approaches %in  \cite{OOPSLA22,dd,VerX,irisWasm23}  
 are based on temporal logics \cite{VerX,OOPSLA22}, or on extensions of Coq/Iris \cite{dd,irisWasm23,ddd}, and
none offer a Hoare logic    for external calls.
%Other approaches in the literature are either unable to handle external method calls \cite{OOPSLA22}, or use  bespoke proofs \cite{dd,irisWasm23}, or model checking \cite{VerX}.
%Their specification languages are based on temporal logics \cite{VerX,OOPSLA22}, or on extensions of Coq and Iris \cite{dd,IrisWasm23}.
%More in  \S \ref{app:expressivity}. 
% we argue our approach is able to prove comparable specifications to those proposed in  \cite{OOPSLA22,dd,VerX,irisWasm23}, in the presence of external method calls, using a Hoare logic.=≠≠≠q±±≠≠≠qq≠q≠≠www≠≠
%We   summarize here.

 %% We continue the comparison of expresiveness between \emph{Chainmail} and \Nec, by 
 %% considering the examples studied in \cite{FASE}.
 
%\begin{example}[ERC20]

%\paragraphSDD{DOM} % is the motivating example  in \cite{dd}:
%Access to any DOM node
%gives read/write  permissions to  all its \prg{parent} and \prg{children} nodes. 
%These permissions are attenuated   through a \prg{Proxy} class, %which has a field \prg{node} pointing to a \prg{Node}, and a field \prg{height}, 
% which restricts the range of \prg{Node}s which may be modified through the use of the particular \prg{Proxy}. 
%We  express such  attenuation   through two scoped invariants.
%% The corresponding specification in \ref{OOPSLA22} is comparable, but not able to prove external calls. % not specific as to the frame from which any modification originated.
%
%\paragraphSDD{DAO} %Decentralized Autonomous Organization\
% ~\cite{Dao}  is a well-known Ethereum contract   which was exploited with a re-entrancy bug in 2016, 
%and lost \$50M. 
%Our scoped invariants  would have secured %the DAO 
% against that bug. % such a  bug. 
%But note  that  they are about precluded effects, and 
%%. They are, essentially, simple object invariants and 
%thus expressible % could have been expressed 
% with techniques proposed in the 90's \cite{MeyerDBC92}.
%% \cite{OOPSLA22}  gives one  further specification, which says  that any reduction of funds can only be caused through a call to a specific method -- such specifications are beoind our scope.
% 
% \paragraphSDD{ERC20} is a widely used % token 
% standard describing  basic functionality of Ethereum-based token 
%contracts. 
%The Solidity security model is not based on access to  capabilities but on who the caller  is. 
%We  adapted our approach correspondingly, and 
%express 1) that  the owner of an account is always authorized on that account,  2) any execution which does not contain calls from a participant  authorized on some account will not affect the balance nor  who is authorized on  that account. 
%% The specifications from \cite{OOPSLA22} are more API-specific, in that they pinpoint which method calls caused an effect, and less specific in that they do not pinpoint the frame from which the effect occurred. 
%
%\paragraphSDD{Stack} is a Wasm module exporting separate functions to read or modify its contents \cite{irisWasm23}. We specify that in the absence of external access to the latter capability, the contents will not change.  
%
%\paragraphSDD{Sealer/Unsealer} was proposed by \citet{JamesMorris} and formalized in \cite{ddd}. It proposes an unsealer for  safe passing of sealed high-integrity values. Our specification says that without access to the unsealer, the value does not get read, and that the unsealer does not get leaked.
