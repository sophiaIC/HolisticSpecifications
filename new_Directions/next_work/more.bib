abstract = {Current standard security practices do not provide substantial assurance that the
end-to-end behavior of a computing system satisfies important security policies such
as confidentiality. An end-to-end confidentiality policy might assert that secret
input data cannot be inferred by an attacker through the attacker's observations of
system output; this policy regulates information flow. Conventional security mechanisms
such as access control and encryption do not directly address the enforcement of information-flow
policies. Previously, a promising new approach has been developed: the use of programming-language
techniques for specifying and enforcing information-flow policies. In this paper,
we survey the past three decades of research on information-flow security, particularly
focusing on work that uses static program analysis to enforce information-flow policies.
We give a structured view of work in the area and identify some important open challenges.},

abstract = {Sandboxing is a common technique that allows low-level, untrusted components to safely
interact with trusted code. However, previous work has only investigated the low-level
memory isolation guarantees of sandboxing, leaving open the question of the end-to-end
guarantees that sandboxing affords programmers. In this paper, we fill this gap by
showing that sandboxing enables reasoning about the known concept of robust safety,
i.e., safety of the trusted code even in the presence of arbitrary untrusted code.
To do this, we first present an idealized operational semantics for a language that
combines trusted code with untrusted code. Sandboxing is built into our semantics.
Then, we prove that safety properties of the trusted code (as enforced through a rich
type system) are upheld in the presence of arbitrary untrusted code, so long as all
interactions with untrusted code occur at the “any” type (a type inhabited by all
values). Finally, to alleviate the burden of having to interact with untrusted code
at only the “any” type, we formalize and prove safe several wrappers, which automatically
convert values between the “any” type and much richer types. All our results are mechanized
in the Coq proof assistant.},
