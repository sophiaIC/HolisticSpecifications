 In today's complex software, internal, trusted, code  is tightly intertwined  
with external, untrusted, code: external code may call  methods 
from the  internal  code, and internal code may call method from the external code.
% In particular, trusted  code may be called by external, unverified, untrusted code; moreover, it may call such external, unverified, untrusted code
Thus, \emph{external calls}, \ie internal code calling methods from external code, may, in principle, have an unlimited range of effects.

Nevertheless, the effects of external calls, can be \emph{\tamed}, \ie reduced, if the internal module %makes use of encapsulation and
  is programmed so as to prevent some effects from happening.
\Tamed effects allow us to reason that external call will preserve some assertions.
%
To \tame effects, one needs to use encapsulation (\eg private fields, no address forging, \etc). 
One may also employ   the OCAP (object capabilities) model, whereby 
% capabilities are transferable rights to perform one or more operations on a given object;
access to the capability is  necessary for some  effect to  happen.
%Capabilities are unforgeable, and can only be acquired through explicit passing from caller to callee, or at object creation.
 % As a result, sharing of capabilities has to be carefully managed.
%

Our work addresses the specification and verification of internal code which uses encapsulation and OCAP to \tame effects.
We propose new assertions talking about access to capabilities,
new specifications describing \tamed effects,
a Hoare logic that can verify external calls, and a Hoare logic that can verify that a module satisfies its \tamed effects specification.
We prove soundness of the Hoare logic.
We illusrate the approach though a running example. 
%% -- something not yet sufficiently  tackled by the OCAP  literature.
%{\textbf {For the specification:}} To describe
% not being ``entitled'' to some effect, we give a means to guarantee  that lack of (eventual) access to certain capabilities ensures
%that certain effects will not take place.
% To reflect that the guarantees
%should hold in the presence of internal code calling and being called by external code, we 
%% are about eventual} effects we 
%propose {\emph{scoped invariants}}, where the notion of the future is  {constrained} by the currently executing method. 
%%We propose means to specify the preservation of such properties, and the meaning of being ``entitled'' to some effect. 
%To define the   management of sharing of capabilities, we propose the concept of  protected capability which guarantees  that access by external objects
% is controlled by the internal objects.
%

%%  Our specification language can express that capabilities are necessary (rather than sufficient) conditions for certain effects
%%(thus going further than traditional object capabilities).

%{\textbf {For the verification: }} We  propose Hoare logic inference rules   {to prove} that calls to external code are safe. 
%We also propose inference rules   {to prove}    that  {our} modules satisfy our specifications.
%We then  {demonstrate}  that a sound   Hoare logic augmented by the proposed rules is also sound. 
%We use a motivating example  and   prove its properties using our logic.
